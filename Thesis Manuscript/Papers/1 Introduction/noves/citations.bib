	abstract = {Nonmetallic solids have a band gap in the one-electron picture. When particle interactions are considered, a large number of bound electron-hole states are found within the gap. These states, called excitons, play a large role in determining the optical properties of nonmetals. We discuss the electronic structure of excitons, their interactions with phonons and photons, and their further role of transporting excitation energy.},
