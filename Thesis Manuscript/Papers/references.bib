   abstract = {During 1970s, acid rain had devastated several regions of North America and Western Europe. Since then counter measures implemented in these regions have gradually brought the problem under some control. But has the world nullified what was once a very strongly perceived threat of acid rain? Far from it; studies conducted in recent years show that acid rain is now as severe a threat to the developing world, especially India and China, as it was earlier to some of the developed countries. Even the latter have only partially recovered from the earlier episodes of excessively acidic rain and still have a long way to go. The purpose of this review is to call attention towards the still very real threat of acid rain in the context of its past and the present. This paper recapitulates the definition of acid rain, traces its history, and identifies its origins. It then discusses the impact of acid rain, especially the trans-national and trans-regional issues associated with it. The prognostics for developing countries are highlighted. The measures to control and prevent acid rain are then recapitulated.},

Yet, the overall cost of generating electricity using the most advanced silicon based solar cells remains high compared to both traditional and other renewable power generation approaches. Organic thin film photovoltaics are an emerging economically competitive photovoltaic technology that combines manufacturing adaptability, low-cost processing and a lightweight, flexible device end-product. At present, however, commercial use of organic photovoltaics is hindered by low conversion efficiency and poor overall stability of the devices. Encapsulation with high barrier performance materials and structures is one of the key ways to address these issues and improve device lifetime. This paper will briefly outline the current understanding of the major degradation mechanisms, their interrelation and the internal and external factors that initiate these processes. Then, the paper will provide an overview of currently available encapsulant materials, their utility in limiting chemical (water vapor and oxygen penetration) and mechanical degradation within individual layers and device as a whole, and potential drawbacks to their application in organic photovoltaic devices. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here we systematically investigate the influence of end-group fluorination density and positioning on the physicochemical properties, single-crystal packing, end-group redistribution propensity, and BHJ photovoltaic performance of a series of ITIC variants, ITIC-nF (n = 0, 2, 3, 4, and 6). Increasing n from 0 → 6 contracts the optical bandgap, but only marginally lowers the LUMO for n > 4. This yields enhanced photovoltaic short-circuit current density and good open-circuit voltage, so that ITIC-6F achieves the highest PCE of the series, approaching 12% in blends with the PBDB-TF donor polymer. Single-crystal diffraction reveals that the ITIC-nF molecules cofacially interleave with ITIC-6F having the shortest π-π distance of 3.28 Å. This feature together with ZINDO-level computed intermolecular electronic coupling integrals as high as 57 meV, and B3LYP/DZP-level reorganization energies as low as 147 meV, rival or surpass the corresponding values for fullerenes, ITIC-0F, and ITIC-4F, and track a positive correlation between the ITIC-nF space-charge limited electron mobility and n. Finally, a heretofore unrecognized solution-phase redistribution process between the 2-(3-oxo-indan-1-ylidene)-malononitrile-derived end-groups (EGs) of IDTT-based NFAs, i.e., EG 1 -IDTT-EG 1 + EG 2 -IDTT-EG 2 ⇄ 2 EG 1 -IDTT-EG 2 , with implications for the entire ITIC PSC field, is identified and mechanistically characterized, and the effects on PSC performance are assessed.},

These estimates are compared to those for ten other electricity generation technologies whose costs were identified by the UK Government (DTI, 2006). Under plausible assumptions for costs and performance, point estimates of the levelised costs of Wave and Tidal Stream generation are £190 and £81/MWh, respectively. Sensitivity analysis shows how these relative private levelised costs calculations are affected by variation in key parameters, specifically the assumed capital costs, fuel costs and the discount rate. We also consider the impact of the introduction of technology-differentiated financial support for renewable energy on the cost competitiveness of Wave and Tidal Stream power. Further, we compare the impact of the current UK government support level to the more generous degree of assistance for marine technologies that is proposed by the Scottish government. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Though impressive, further development is required to ensure a bright industrial future for organic photovoltaics. Relatively narrow spectral overlap of organic polymer absorption bands within the solar spectrum is one of the major limitations of organic solar cells. Among different strategies that are in progress to tackle this restriction, the novel concept of ternary organic solar cells is a promising candidate to extend the absorption spectra of large bandgap polymers to the near IR region and to enhance light harvesting in single bulk-heterojunction solar cells.

   abstract = {In the last two decades, through technological, experimental and theoretical advances, the situation in experimental fission studies has changed dramatically. With the use of advanced production and detection techniques both much more detailed and precise information can now be obtained for the traditional regions of fission research and, crucially, new regions of nuclei have become routinely accessible for fission studies. This work first of all reviews the recent developments in experimental fission techniques, in particular the resurgence of transfer-induced fission reactions with light and heavy ions, the emerging use of inverse-kinematic approaches, both at Coulomb and relativistic energies, and of fission studies with radioactive beams. The emphasis on the fission-fragment mass and charge distributions will be made in this work, though some of the other fission observables, such as prompt neutron and γ-ray emission will also be reviewed. A particular attention will be given to the low-energy fission in the so far scarcely explored nuclei in the very neutron-deficient lead region. They recently became the focus for several complementary experimental studies, such as β-delayed fission with radioactive beams at ISOLDE(CERN), Coulex-induced fission of relativistic secondary beams at FRS(GSI), and several prompt fusion-fission studies. The synergy of these approaches allows a unique insight in the new region of asymmetric fission around 180Hg, recently discovered at ISOLDE. Recent extensive theoretical efforts in this region will also be outlined. The unprecedented high-quality data for fission fragments, completely identified in Z and A, by means of reactions in inverse kinematics at FRS(GSI) and VAMOS(GANIL) will be also reviewed. These experiments explored an extended range of mercury-to-californium elements, spanning from the neutron-deficient to neutron-rich nuclides, and covering both asymmetric, symmetric and transitional fission regions. Some aspects of heavy-ion induced fusion-fission and quasifission reactions will be also discussed, which reveal their dynamical features, such as the fission time scale. The crucial role of the multi-chance fission, probed by means of multinucleon-transfer induced fission reactions, will be highlighted. The review will conclude with the discussion of the new experimental fission facilities which are presently being brought into operation, along with promising 'next-generation' fission approaches, which might become available within the next decade.},

However, compared to silicon photodiodes, sensitivity and dynamic behavior remain a major challenge with organic sensors. Here, we show that charge trapping phenomena deteriorate the bandwidth of organic photodiodes (OPDs) to a few Hz at low-light levels. We demonstrate that, despite the large OPD capacitances of ∼10 nF cm -2, a frequency response in the kHz regime can be achieved at light levels as low as 20 nW cm -2 by appropriate interface engineering, which corresponds to a 1000-fold increase compared to state-of-the-art OPDs. Such device characteristics indicate that large active area OPDs are suitable for industrial sensing and even match medical requirements for single X-ray pulse detection in the millisecond range.},

   abstract = {Spectrally selective light detection is vital for full-colour and near-infrared (NIR) imaging and machine vision. This is not possible with traditional broadband-absorbing inorganic semiconductors without input filtering, and is yet to be achieved for narrowband absorbing organic semiconductors. We demonstrate the first sub-100 nm full-width-at-half-maximum visible-blind red and NIR photodetectors with state-of-the-art performance across critical response metrics. These devices are based on organic photodiodes with optically thick junctions. Paradoxically, we use broadband-absorbing organic semiconductors and utilize the electro-optical properties of the junction to create the narrowest NIR-band photoresponses yet demonstrated. In this context, these photodiodes outperform the encumbent technology (input filtered inorganic semiconductor diodes) and emerging technologies such as narrow absorber organic semiconductors or quantum nanocrystals. The design concept allows for response tuning and is generic for other spectral windows. Furthermore, it is materialagnostic and applicable to other disordered and polycrystalline semiconductors.},

   abstract = {Organic semiconductors offer significant advantages as photoactive materials for solar energy conversion, such as ease of synthesis, processing and tunability of properties. However, their efficiency and stability are significantly lower than competing technologies and this hinders their widespread commercialisation. Organic semiconductors are characterised by the relatively soft nature of the materials along with a strong coupling between electronic and vibrational modes. The aim of this work is to understand how the molecular nature of the materials limits the attainable power conversion efficiency of a device. Properly understanding how the properties of the molecules affect the device performance will serve as the basis to develop new chemical compounds for efficient and stable organic solar cells. In this thesis I have focused on understanding the origin of the open-circuit voltage (V_oc) losses in organic solar cells. V_oc Corresponds to the difference between the quasi-fermi levels at the contacts in an illuminated solar cell at zero current flow and is one of the characteristics of the device that controls power conversion efficiency (PCE). I used a combination of modelling and simulation to explain the experimentally measured voltage losses in series of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, aiming to understand which properties of the molecules impact the open circuit voltage of the devices. The main results of this thesis are presented in two chapters: In Chapter 4, I introduce a model for the voltage losses in OPV devices based on the radiative and non-radiative decay of the lowest energy charge transfer (CT) state and discuss its use. This CT state is formed at the interface between the donor and acceptor molecules in bulk-heterojunction solar cells. Using the model, I highlight the properties of the CT state that best explain trends in the voltage losses of OPV devices. These properties are related to the chemical structure of the molecules and their spatial arrangement. Therefore, these results serve as guidelines for developing molecules that would reduce the open circuit voltage losses. In chapter 5, I explore how to reliably characterise the recombination of the free charge carriers in OPV devices using optoelectronic techniques. Using a device simulation tool, I show that a commonly used characterisation technique (transient photovoltage (TPV)) is often unreliable. From the conclusions of the simulation I developed a modified characterisation technique (transient photo-charge (TPQ)) that overcomes the limitations of TPV. In the last section of chapter 5, I show how the combined use of the model in chapter 4 and the optoelectronic techniques can help further understand the photo-generation and recombination processes in OPV devices. Overall using a combination of molecular and device simulation approaches, I explored the correlation between the molecular properties of the organic semiconductors and the losses in the OPV devices. This work helps refine our understanding of the voltage losses in OPV devices and how to improve them.},

   abstract = {Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) can be used to extend the response of solar cells, enabling the utilization of solar power that lies to the red of the bandgap of c-Si and perovskites. To achieve largely complete absorption of infrared (IR) photons in CQD solids requires thicknesses on the micrometer range; however, this exceeds the typical diffusion lengths (≈300 nm) of photoexcited charges in these materials. Nanostructured metal back electrodes that grant the cell efficient IR light trapping in thin active layers with no deterioration of the electrical properties are demonstrated. Specifically, a new hole-transport layer (HTL) is developed and directly nanostructured. Firstly, a material set to replace conventional rigid HTLs in CQD devices is developed with a moldable HTL that combines the mechanical and chemical requisites for nanoimprint lithography with the optoelectronic properties necessary to retain efficient charge extraction through an optically thick layer. The new HTL is nanostructured in a 2D lattice and conformally coated with MoO3/Ag. The photonic structure in the back electrode provides a record photoelectric conversion efficiency of 86%, beyond the Si bandgap, and a 22% higher IR power conversion efficiency compared to the best previous reports.},

Individual materials as well as blends and solar cell devices were examined. Light absorption, photoluminescence, quantum efficiency, total efficiency, and currentvoltage characteristics were studied from temperatures -10 to 140 °C. A method and apparatus for testing these parameters at various temperatures is described. Parameters were measured for both unannealed and annealed samples to give insight into the annealing process. It was found that absorption and photoluminescence of devices shift both position and intensity with varying temperatures. Quantum efficiency and total efficiency were monitored as they increased with annealing. Once annealed, device efficiency peaked at temperatures from 10 to 60 °C because of competing temperature dependent effects of the materials. The temperature dependence study provides valuable information on device properties and thermal annealing. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Up to now, perovskite photodetectors are mainly based on polycrystalline thin films, which have some undesired properties such as large defective grain boundaries hindering the further improvement of the detector performance. Here, perovskite thin-single-crystal (TSC) photodetectors are fabricated with a vertical p–i–n structure. Due to the absence of grain-boundaries, the trap densities of TSCs are 10–100 folds lower than that of polycrystalline thin films. The photodetectors based on CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3 TSCs show low noise of 1–2 fA Hz−1/2, yielding a high specific detectivity of 1.5 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1. The absence of grain boundaries reduces charge recombination and enables a linear response under strong light, superior to polycrystalline photodetectors. The CH3NH3PbBr3 photodetectors show a linear response to green light from 0.35 pW cm−2 to 2.1 W cm−2, corresponding to a linear dynamic range of 256 dB.},

Status Solidi B 175, 15 (1993)], which has become one of the most popular references in this research field. Thanks to this paper, our understanding of charge transport in disordered organic materials has been essentially improved in the past two decades. New theoretical methods have been developed and new results on various phenomena related to charge transport in disordered organic materials have been obtained. The aim of the current review is to present these new theoretical methods and to highlight the most essential results obtained in their framework. While theoretical consideration in the article by Bässler was based on computer simulations, particular attention in the current review is given to the development of analytical theories. Dependences of charge carrier mobility and diffusivity on temperature, electric field, carrier concentration and on material and sample parameters are discussed in detail. Schematic behaviour of charge carriers within the Gaussian density of states (DOS) Organic disordered semiconductors (ODS) dominate already today the electrophotographic image recording on the industrial scale and are becoming more and more important for applications in light-emitting diodes, in field-effect transistors, in solar cells and other devices.

Our finding is supported by experimental measurements on 15 different donor:acceptor combinations, as well as by drift-diffusion simulations of organic solar cells in which charge-carrier mobilities, recombination rate, light intensity, energy levels and active-layer thickness are all varied over wide ranges to reproduce typical experimental conditions. The results unify the fill factors of several very different donor:acceptor combinations and give insight into why fill factors change so much with thickness, light intensity and materials properties.

Additional cells have been measured with open-circuit voltages of up to 1.11 V, while still maintaining respectable fill factors and no rollover. The lack of rollover, either before or after open circuit, confirms the potential of this approach to reach very high efficiencies. The optical losses within the device are quantified and analyzed across the spectrum to determine if there exists potential for increased current generation through a reduction in parasitic absorption. In addition, fitting the current-voltage characteristic reveals that the leading cause of the less-than-ideal fill factor is series resistance, which contributes a 7% absolute loss.},

It produces 3930 (TW.h).a−1, and yields 16% of the world's generated electricity and about 78% of renewable electricity generation (in 2015). Hydropower and climate change show a double relationship. On the one hand, as an important renewable energy resource, hydropower contributes significantly to the avoidance of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to the mitigation of global warming. On the other hand, climate change is likely to alter river discharge, impacting water availability and hydropower generation. Hydropower contributes significantly to the reduction of GHG emissions and to energy supply security. Compared with conventional coal power plants, hydropower prevents the emission of about 3 GT CO2 per year, which represents about 9% of global annual CO2 emissions. Hydropower projects may also have an enabling role beyond the electricity sector, as a financing instrument for multipurpose reservoirs and as an adaptive measure regarding the impacts of climate change on water resources, because regulated basins with large reservoir capacities are more resilient to water resource changes, less vulnerable to climate change, and act as a storage buffer against climate change. At the global level, the overall impact of climate change on existing hydropower generation may be expected to be small, or even slightly positive. However, there is the possibility of substantial variations across regions and even within countries. In conclusion, the general verdict on hydropower is that it is a cheap and mature technology that contributes significantly to climate change mitigation, and could play an important role in the climate change adaptation of water resource availability. However, careful attention is necessary to mitigate the substantial environmental and social costs. Roughly more than a terawatt of capacity could be added in upcoming decades.},

However, the NREL certified PCE of large area OPV modules is still lagging far behind (11.7% in July 2020). Additionally, there has been a rapidly growing interest in the use of OPVs for dim light indoor applications, with reported PCE of some large area (≥1 cm2) devices, under 1000 lux, well above 20%. The transition of OPV from the lab to the market requires the development of effective manufacturing processes that can scale-up laboratory-scale devices into large area devices, without sacrificing performance and simultaneously minimizing associated manufacturing costs. This review article focuses on four important challenges that OPV technology has to face to achieve a reliable lab-to-fab transfer, namely: i) The upscaling of indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-based single cells and the interconnection of single cells into large area modules; ii) the development of alternatives to vacuum processing; iii) the development of alternatives to ITO-based substrates; and iv) strategies for improving the lifetime of large area OPV devices.},

   abstract = {Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technique aims to realize roll-to-roll printing of semi-transparent, mechanically flexible and low-cost photovoltaic devices. The reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), based on high performance light-harvesting materials, have been close to the requirement of practical application. However, scaling up and processability of the materials have become one of the main barriers inhibiting the OPV commercialization. In order to provide ideas for solving the cost issue, a series of low-cost p-type copolymers, PTV-X (X represents different alkyl side chains) with copolymerization of thienylene and vinylene as backbones, are prepared and characterized. It was demonstrated that PTV-based materials possess almost flat structure and broad absorption spectra range from 300 to 750 nm. Besides, the hole mobilities of the optimized materials are up to magnitude of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Importantly, the PTV-X family polymers can work effectively with various representative fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors. A regioregular polymer, namely PTVT-C12, is synthesized based on monomers of (thiophene-vinylene-thiophene) TVT-C12 and V–Sn to further modulate the morphological properties of the PTV-series polymers. The more ordered chain packing was observed in PTVT-C12 film and enhanced charge carrier mobility was realized in PTVT-C12 based OSC device. As a result, a PCE of 6.44% is exhibited by the device based on PTVT-C12: BO-4Cl. This study suggests that PTV-series materials are being worthy of consideration for the development of low-cost materials for the future OPV commercialization.},

In order to enhance the longevity of microsystems or sensor networks, it is necessary for these devices to be self-powered. Indoor photovoltaics allow the possibility of harvesting artificial light sources for powering microsystems. Whereas indoor photovoltaics based on single active layers have showed high efficiencies under LED lighting, tandem structures have yet to be tested extensively. In our study, we use finite-difference time-domain simulations to study the highest possible short-circuit current density that can be extracted from tandem organic devices. We compare the simulation results to the results for photovoltaic devices based on single bulk active layer heterojunctions. Our simulations found that although detailed balanced band gap calculations show tandem photovoltaics to be viable, the low-intensity emission spectra of white LED light sources can be better harvested by single active layer-based photovoltaics. The current-matching limitation of a tandem photovoltaic structure connected in series limits the highest output current and open-circuit voltage of the device and, thus, its performance for the illumination of lower intensity light.},

Although large variations are found in published mobility values on identical materials, there is little open discussion in the literature of the reproducibility of these results. We address this with an interlaboratory study of mobility measurements performed on a set of organic semiconductors using the space-charge limited current method. We found mobility measured on nominally identical devices could vary by more than one order of magnitude, with the largest sources of variation being poor electrodes and film thickness variation. Moreover, we found that mobility values extracted from identical data by different scientists would typically vary by a factor of 3. We propose a protocol for analysis and reporting that was found to reduce this analysis variation to as little as 20%. We also present general guidelines for improving the reproducibility of benchmark mobility measurements. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Tandem modules combining a III–V top cell with a Si bottom cell offer the potential to increase the solar energy conversion efficiency of one-sun photovoltaic modules beyond 25%, while fully utilizing the global investment that has been made in Si photovoltaics manufacturing. At present, the cost of III–V cells is far too high for this approach to be competitive for one-sun terrestrial power applications. We investigated the system-level economic benefits of both GaAs/Si and InGaP/Si tandem modules in favorable future scenarios where the cost of III–V cells is substantially reduced, perhaps to less than the cost of Si cells. We found, somewhat unexpectedly, that these tandems can reduce installed system cost only when the area-related balance-of-system cost is high, such as for area-constrained residential rooftop systems in the USA. When area-related balance-of-system cost is lower, such as for utility-scale systems, the tandem module offers no benefit. This is because a system using tandem modules is more expensive than one using single-junction Si modules when III–V cells are expensive, and a system using tandem modules is more expensive than one using single-junction III–V modules when III–V cells are inexpensive.

   abstract = {Multi-junction photovoltaic devices include two or more component sub-cells which are electrically interconnected in series. At any power point, the current output of the total device is limited by the sub-cell with the smallest current density. Therefore, the maximum efficiency is reached when the sub-cells have equal current densities at their respective maximum power points. In this case the sub-cells are so called "power matched". We report an experimental procedure in which the current-voltage characteristics of tandem solar cells can be measured under various irradiance spectra, i.e. under various short-circuit current matching conditions. This permits the probing of the optimized short circuit current mismatch, where the sub-cells are power matched, which is essential to define design rules for the tandem stack. The method applies well to devices where one of the sub-cells is metastable. We show that, in the case of thin-film silicon tandem cells, the optimum mismatch changes significantly after light induced degradation. Consequently, the degradation factor of such devices is shown to depend not only on material quality but also on the initial short circuit current matching. This experiment also provides relative quantification of the fill factors of each sub-cell. Our example suggests that a high bottom cell deposition rate can be detrimental to the fill factor of the top cell in the case of thin-film silicon tandem cells deposited in superstrate configuration. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Production and costs of alternative CSP technologies are strongly non-uniform. Without thermal energy storage (TES), actualized construction costs are 5213–6672 $/kW for CSP PT and 6084 $/kW for CSP ST. With TES, the actualized costs of PT and ST increase to 8258 $/kW and 9227 $/kW respectively. The annual capacity factors of the more reliable PT plants are 28–29% without TES, and 29–33% with TES. ST plants presently deliver much smaller annual capacity factors even when boosted by natural gas (NG) combustion, or fitted with TES. ST appears to be less mature and more troublesome technology than PT. TES is still not delivering the expected improvements suffering efficiency and reliability issues. PV are less expensive than CSP, with actualized construction costs 4739 $/kW. However, as the capacity factors of PV plants are only 26.3–28.5%, CSP already deliver a 1–2% better capacity factors even without TES. In a decadal perspective, PV may certainly suffer soon of the competition by CSP, more likely PT, with the addition of TES, once this energy storage technology will mature, if a simple but reliable mass production product could be defined.},

If the solution is polydisperse, the measured diffusion coefficient will be an average over all species. Koppel showed that if the autocorrelation function is analyzed in terms of its cumulants, the diffusion coefficient will be a z average. If the particle dimensions are not small compared with the wavelength of light, however, this conclusion will hold only in the limit of zero scattering angle, since at higher angles the form factors of the larger particles decrease their contributions relative to the smaller particles. We show how the slopes and intercepts of plots of K1/K2 and K2/K4 (where K1 and K2 are the first and second cumulants, and K is the scattering vector, (4 π/λ) sin (θ/2)) can be analyzed to yield four z averages of the polymer radius distribution function: (R-1), (R-2), (R), and (R2).

Here we investigate a promising system consisting of a hematite photoanode in combination with dye-sensitized solar cells with newly developed organic dyes, such as the squaraine dye, which permit new configurations of this tandem system. Three configurations were investigated: two side-by-side dye cells behind a semitransparent hematite photoanode, two semitransparent dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs) in front of the hematite, and a trilevel hematite/DSC/DSC architecture. Based on the current-voltage curves of state-of-the-art devices made in our laboratories, we found the trilevel tandem architecture (hematite/SQ1 dye/N749 dye) produces the highest operating current density and thus the highest expected solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (1.36% compared with 1.16% with the standard back DSC case and 0.76% for the front DSC case). Further investigation into the wavelength-dependent quantum efficiency of each component revealed that in each case photons lost as a result of scattering and reflection reduce the performance from the expected 3.3% based on the nanostructured hematite photoanodes. We further suggest avenues for the improvement of each configuration from both the DSC and the photoanode parts.},

   abstract = {A comparison of performance parameters for first, second and third generation PV technologies has been conducted. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules displayed markedly different outdoor performance characteristics to other PV technologies owing to the positive temperature coefficient, lower thermal mass and response under low light conditions. The linear relationship between irradiance and module temperature rise above ambient is studied, leading to calculation of values for the Ross coefficient for OPV modules. OPVs are shown to possess a lower Ross coefficient than poly-Si, due to the lower absorption of infrared radiation. The effect of wind speed on the Ross coefficient is also investigated, showing the effect that module structure has upon outdoor PV performance, with the OPV module cooling quicker under windy conditions than the poly-Si due to a lower thermal mass. A long term stability study on OPV modules with a silver nanowire-zinc oxide (AgNW-ZnO) composite front electrode has showed two phases of degradation: a short initial burn-in with significant drops in performance; followed by stabilisation and degradation progressing at a much slower rate. During the burn-in period the modules showed diurnal reversible degradation in the short circuit current (ISC), whereas open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) show a steady decline. The reversible degradation is assumed to be related to the desorption of oxygen from the ZnO layer during the day due to UV excitation, leading to an increase in trap formation and a drop in current generation capacity, followed by re-adsorption of the oxygen overnight.},

Over the course of a day, efficiency gradually increases as a result of a concomitant increase in short-circuit current, while the fill factor and open-circuit voltage remain constant. The results are analyzed on the basis of independent measurements of temperature- and intensity-dependent OPV performance. The power conversion efficiency is maximized slightly below 1 sun intensity and at 40 °C, which is beneficial for practical outdoor operation. We attribute the increased short circuit current with temperature to broadening of the absorption spectrum due to population of phonon states along with increased charge mobility, which also results in an increase in fill factor.},

Typically, these devices are fabricated by processing active and buffer layers on transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs). Superlative OPV devices are small (<≈0.1 cm2). The sheet resistance of available monolithic transparent conductive oxide (TCO) materials limits the performance of larger devices and hence the practically attainable cell area. Here, the use of metallic grids in combination with TCOs to create composite TCEs as a means of scaling solution-processed photovoltaics devices to practical sizes is parameterized. Finite element modeling is used to investigate the relevant design parameters and to estimate figures of merit for realistic organic solar cells. It is shown that the scalability of devices with metallic grids improves significantly when grids are implemented at micrometer scales. Representative silver grids are fabricated and the optical and electrical properties of the resulting structures are measured. Overall, these findings indicate that metallic grids can be designed to develop large-area solution-processed solar cells with currently available fabrication techniques.},

Serious degradation in air limits wide applications of these flexible, light-weight and low-cost power-generation devices. Studying the stability of organic solar cells will help us understand degradation mechanisms and further improve the stability of these devices. There are many investigations into the efficiency and stability of OSCs. The efficiency and stability of devices even of the same photoactive materials are scattered in different papers. In particular, the extrinsic degradation that mainly occurs near the interface between the organic layer and the cathode is a major stability concern. In the past few years, researchers have developed many new cathodes and cathode buffer layers, some of which have astonishingly improved the stability of OSCs. In this review article, we discuss the recent developments of these materials and summarize recent progresses in the study of the degradation/stability of OSCs, with emphasis on the extrinsic degradation/stability that is related to the intrusion of oxygen and water. The review provides detailed insight into the current status of research on the stability of OSCs and seeks to facilitate the development of highly-efficient OSCs with enhanced stability. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Free-space optical communication has finally emerged as a key technology for solving the increasing bandwidth limitations for space communication while reducing the size, weight and power of satellite communication systems, and taking advantage of a license-free spectrum. This chapter focuses on communication links where one of the terminals is in space, and it is organized as follows: Section 34.1 gives a quick overview of key concepts of free-spaceoptical communication (FSOC) that aid in understanding how this technology is used to design lasercom links. Section 34.2 describes how the laser communication signals are affected as they propagate through the atmosphere. Sections 34.3 and 34.4 explain the two applications with greater potential, each having unique characteristics and advantages.

   abstract = {Planar metal-oxide-metal structures can serve as photodetectors that do not rely on the usual electron-hole pair generation in a semiconductor. Instead, absorbed light in one of the metals can produce a current of hot electrons when the incident photon energy exceeds the oxide barrier energy. Despite the desirable traits of convenient fabrication and room-temperature operation at zero bias of this type of device, the low power conversion efficiency has limited its use. Here, we demonstrate the benefits of reshaping one of the metallic contacts into a plasmonic stripe antenna. We use measurements of the voltage-dependence, spectral-dependence, stripe-width dependence, and polarization-dependence of the photocurrent to show that surface plasmon excitations can result in a favorable redistribution in the electric fields in the stripe that enhances the photocurrent. We also provide a theoretical model that quantifies the spectral photocurrent in terms of the electrical and optical properties of the junction. This model provides an accurate estimate of the bias dependence of the external quantum efficiency of different devices and shows that both the spatial and vectorial properties of the electric field distribution are important to its operation. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

Various processing techniques have been explored to improve the nanoscale morphology of the BHJ layer, e.g., by varying the casting solvent, thermal annealing, solvent annealing, and solvent additives. This paper highlights the role of residual solvent in the "dried" BHJ layer, and the effect of residual solvents on PCBM diffusion and ultimately the stability of the morphology. We show that solvent is retained within the BHJ film despite prolonged heat treatment, leading to extensive phase separation, as demonstrated by the growth in the size and quantity of PCBM agglomerates. The addition of a small volume fraction of nitrobenzene to the casting solution inhibits the diffusion of PCBM in the dry film, resulting in smaller PCBM agglomerates, and improves the fill factor of the BHJ device to 0.61 without further tempering. The addition of nitrobenzene also increases the P3HT crystalline content, while increasing the onset temperature for melting of P3HT side chains and backbone. The melting temperature for PCBM is also higher with the nitrobenzene additive present. Copyright © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

   abstract = {Recombination energy loss is the main impediment on improving the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). The pernicious effect is usually induced by two dynamics, that is, the geminate recombination of nascent charge pairs soon after the exciton dissociation and nongeminate recombination of separated charges during their transportation. Both hinder achieving high open-circuit voltage (VOC). Here, we comprehensively investigated the relationship between crystallization and molecular recombination in a non-fullerene system of poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T):((5Z,50Z)-5,50-(((4,4,9,9-tetraoctyl-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b0]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadia-zole-7,4-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-ethyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one)) (O-IDTBR). Based on a quantitative characterization of crystallinity, it was found that the crystallization intensity ratio between components is the key factor to suppress recombination energy losses. The nongeminate recombination showed increased probability with enlarged variance of crystallinity between the donor and acceptor. The geminate recombination was proven to be restricted by the energetic disorder of the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, as well as the phase separation induced by crystallization. The rational crystallization intensity ratio between donor/acceptor (D/A) components is vital in achieving minimum energy loss as well as best device performance. The results are favorable for comprehending the effects of crystallinity in charge transfer and charge transport dynamics and provide guidance for morphology and crystallinity optimization in non-fullerene OSCs.},

   abstract = {Owing to their high efficiency, low-cost solution-processability, and tunable bandgap, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) made of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite (HOIP) thin films are promising top-cell candidates for integration with bottom-cells based on Si or other low-bandgap solar-cell materials to boost the power conversion efficiency (PCE) beyond the Shockley-Quiesser (S-Q) limit. In this review, recent progress in such tandem solar cells based on the emerging PSCs is summarized and reviewed critically. Notable achievements for different tandem solar cell configurations including mechanically-stacked, optical coupling, and monolithically-integrated with PSCs as top-cells are described in detail. Highly-efficient semitransparent PSC top-cells with high transmittance in near-infrared (NIR) region are critical for tandem solar cells. Different types of transparent electrodes with high transmittance and low sheet-resistance for PSCs are reviewed, which presents a grand challenge for PSCs. The strategies to obtain wide-bandgap PSCs with good photo-stability are discussed. The PCE reduction due to reflection loss, parasitic absorption, electrical loss, and current mismatch are analyzed to provide better understanding of the performance of PSC-based tandem solar cells.},

   abstract = {Organic solar cells (OSCs) can be unstable under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. To address this issue and enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE), an inorganic-perovskite/organic four-terminal tandem solar cell (TSC) based on a semitransparent inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cell (pero-SC) as the top cell and an OSC as bottom cell is constructed. The high-quality CsPbBr3 photoactive layer of the planar pero-SC is prepared with a dual-source vacuum coevaporation method, using stoichiometric precursors of CsBr and PbBr2 with a low evaporation rate. The resultant opaque planar pero-SC exhibits an ultrahigh open-circuit voltage of 1.44 V and the highest reported PCE of 7.78% for a CsPbBr3-based planar pero-SC. Importantly, the devices show no degradation after 120 h UV light illumination. The related semitransparent pero-SC can almost completely filter UV light and well maintain photovoltaic performance; it additionally shows an extremely high average visible transmittance. When it is used to construct a TSC, the top pero-SC acting as a UV filter can utilize UV light for photoelectric conversion, avoiding the instability problem of UV light on the bottom OSC that can meet the industrial standards of UV-light stability for solar cells, and leading to the highest reported PCE of 14.03% for the inorganic-perovskite/organic TSC.},

   abstract = {Hydropower is the major renewable energy source for many nations and regions. Dam construction caused direct or indirect detrimental impacts on river systems by altering the water flow pattern and reshaping natural habitats. The dam-induced environmental impact assessment is critical in balancing the human demand for more accessible energy and the ecosystem conservation. In this paper, we proposed information network analysis for assessing environmental impact of hydropower construction based on energy network model of the river system. The framework is capable of evaluating multiple post-dam environmental stressors and tracking energy flows within the disturbed river system. By considering both direct and indirect interactions between system components in the network model, the environmental impacts of sedimentation, discharge change and heavy metal pollution are explicitly evaluated. Dam construction on the upper Mekong River was presented as a case study. The results suggested that the initial dam-induced impact only contributed less than 30% of the cumulative value and that the impact ranking among species, from a network perspective, significantly differed from the traditional toxicological/physiological estimation. Mollusca, benthic-feeding fish and zooplanktivorous fish in the middle trophic levels were most affected by damming, whereas the impact on species at the bottom of the food chain became less prominent in a cumulative way. The most valued species in fishery were found notably impacted and might become endangered because of dam construction. Ad-hoc management actions should be taken to enhance ecosystem conservation and sustainable hydroelectric development in China. By introducing the network approach to the cumulative environmental impact assessment, this study provided insights into a more sustainable path of hydropower construction.},

   abstract = {ConspectusOrganic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted considerable attention in the last two decades to overcome the terawatt energy challenge and serious environmental problems. During their early development, only wide-band-gap organic semiconductors were synthesized and employed as the active layer, mainly utilizing photons in the UV-visible region and yielding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) lower than 5%. Afterward, considerable efforts were made to narrow the polymer donor band gap in order to utilize the infrared photons, which led to the enhancement of the PCE from 5% to 12% in about a decade. Since 2017, the study of narrow-band-gap non-fullerene acceptors helped usher in a new era in OPV research and boosted the achievable the PCE to 17% in only 3 years. In essence, the history of OPV development in the last 15 years can be summarized as an attempt to narrow the band gap of organic semiconductors and better position the energy levels. There are multiple benefits of a narrower band gap: (1) considerable infrared photons can be utilized, and as a result, the short-circuit current density can increase significantly; (2) the energy offset of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels or highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels between the donor and acceptor can be reduced, which will reduce the open-circuit voltage loss by minimizing the loss caused by the donor/acceptor charge transfer state; (3) because of the unique molecular orbitals of organic semiconductors, the red-shifted absorption will induce high transmittance in the visible region, which is ideal for the rear subcells in tandem-junction OPVs and transparent OPVs.In this Account, we first summarize our work beginning in 2008 on the design and synthesis of narrow-band-gap polymer donors/non-fullerene acceptors. Several strategies for constructing these materials, including enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer effect and steric hindrance/energy level engineering are discussed. In this part, in addition to systematic analyses of the design of narrow-band-gap polymer donors based on BDT/TT or BDT/DPP, donors/acceptors based on the new donor moieties DTP or BZPT are discussed as well. Especially, we highlight our work on the first report on the narrow-band-gap acceptor Y1 (based on the new donor moiety BZPT), which pioneered the future development and usage of acceptors belonging to the Y1 family (or series). Subsequently, we analyze several reported certified world record single-junction or tandem-junction OPVs that use these narrow-band-gap donors or acceptors. We share our experiences and insights from a device perspective in terms of donor/acceptor selection, energy level alignment management, film morphology control, current matching of subcells, interconnecting layer construction, interface engineering, and device geometry selection. In this part, the construction of high-performance ternary-blend OPVs and transparent OPVs based on these narrow-band-gap donors/acceptors is also discussed. Finally, in order to push the field into the 20-25% high-efficiency era in the next few years, some suggestions to further develop narrow-band-gap donors/acceptors and related device technologies are proposed.},

Compared to its counterparts such as single-crystalline silicon solar cells or CIGS, PSCs present the obvious advantages of low cost and solution processability. However, the most efficient PSCs are mainly based on devices with an active area of less than 0.1 cm2 by a conventional spin-coating method in the lab. To put forward the commercialization of PSCs, it is mandatorily required to manufacture a large-scale PSC module with practical and scalable fabrication techniques. As one of the most viable and promising scalable techniques, the blade coating process with various types available (including doctor-blade coating, slot-die coating, roller coating) has been widely investigated due to many attractive merits of high PCE, easy operation, low cost with cheap facilities, and high materials utilization ratio. Herein, the challenges of fabricating large-area PSCs and manipulation of film quality for highly efficient PSCs fabricated with blade coating are introduced and discussed.},

   abstract = {With the increasing wealth of digital information stored on computer systems today, security issues have become increasingly important. In addition to attacks targeting the software stack of a system, hardware attacks have become equally likely. Researchers have proposed Secure Processor Architectures which utilize hardware mechanisms for memory encryption and integrity verification to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data and computation, even from sophisticated hardware attacks. While there have been many works addressing performance and other system level issues in secure processor design, power issues have largely been ignored. In this paper, we first analyze the sources of power (energy) increase in different secure processor architectures. We then present a power analysis of various secure processor architectures in terms of their increase in power consumption over a base system with no protection and then provide recommendations for designs that offer the best balance between performance and power without compromising security. We extend our study to the embedded domain as well. We also outline the design of a novel hybrid cryptographic engine that can be used to minimize the power consumption for a secure processor. We believe that if secure processors are to be adopted in future systems (general purpose or embedded), it is critically important that power issues are considered in addition to performance and other system level issues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to examine the power implications of providing hardware mechanisms for security. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The small molecules with weak donating unit (phenylene or naphthalene) have deeper HOMO energy levels than those with strong donating unit (thiophene or thienothiophene), and thus exhibit higher VOC. When the fused aromatic ring (thienothiophene or naphthalene) with planar molecular structure is introduced in SMs, the SMs exhibit high hole mobility and thus afford high JSC. As a result, the introduction of naphthalene (weak donating power and planar structure) enhances both VOC and JSC, resulting in a promising power conversion efficiency of 4.4%.

Land use and climate change result in change in meteorological and hydrological conditions in Nan River Basin. In addition, water demand in the basin has been increasing from the economic development. Understanding cross-sectoral interactions from both water resources and economic points of view provides better insight in planning and management. This study proposes an integrated framework of hydrological and economic analysis to assess impacts of water deficits under changing climate and regional development. The objectives of the study are to analyze water supply under climate change scenarios, estimate water demand under economic development scenarios, and assess cross-sectoral impacts of water deficits. A rainfall-runoff model, integrated flood analysis system (IFAS), was calibrated, verified, and used to simulate runoff. Regional input-output model was developed for Nan River Basin to assess economic impacts of water deficits. Analysis of water deficits under climate change scenarios and economic development scenarios was carried out during the period of 2040-2059. Runoff simulations under climate change scenarios using two GCMs, IPSL-CM5A-MR and MIROC5 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 showed increasing trend. Water demand projections of all sectors also showed increasing trend especially in agricultural sector. The uncertainty of water supply under the climate change scenarios is found to be relatively small compare to the uncertainty of water demand under the economic development scenarios. Assessment of indirect economic loss from cross-sectoral analysis is found to be two to three times higher than the direct loss. The results demonstrate the need to consider the indirect economic loss across sectors in water allocation planning and water deficit mitigation policy.},

Despite the huge growth of output, and the grip of coal and steam on the popular image of the Industrial Revolution, recent cliometric accounts have assumed coal- mining mattered little to the Industrial Revolution. In contrast both E. A. Wrigley and Kenneth Pomeranz have made coal central to the story. This article constructs new series on coal rents, the price of coal at pithead and at market, and the price of firewood, and uses them to examine this issue. We conclude coal output expanded in the Industrial Revolution mainly as a result of increased demand rather than technological innovations in mining. But that expansion could have occurred at any time before 1760. Further, our coal rents series suggests that English possession of coal reserves made a negligible contribution to Industrial Revolution incomes.},

   abstract = {Past, current and projected future population growth is outlined. Barring a calamitous pandemic, a further increase in the world's population from 7 to between 8.8 and 10 billion by mid-century is unavoidable. This increase is driven by high fertility in sub-Saharan Africa whose population is forecast to more than double in the next 40 years and by a modest rise of 23 % in Asia's huge population. Beyond mid-century, the range of plausible demographic destinations widens; much depends on fertility rates in the next few decades because they will determine the number of potential reproducers in the second half of the century. Vigorous promotion of family planning, particularly in Africa, is crucial to achievement of population stabilisation. Unchanged fertility implies a global population of 25 billion by the end of the century. In the next few decades the contribution of human population growth to global environmental change is moderate, because nearly all growth will occur in poor countries where consumption and emission of greenhouse gases is low. The implications for food production, and thereby water consumption, are greater. Much of the future need for food will be driven by increased numbers rather than changing diets. Loss of bio-diversity and natural habitats, degradation of fragile eco-systems due to over-exploitation and aquifer deletion are likely consequences. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

   abstract = {The use of non-fullerene acceptors in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices could lead to enhanced efficiencies due to increased open-circuit voltage (VOC) and improved absorption of solar light. Here we systematically investigate planar heterojunction devices comprising peripherally substituted subphthalocyanines as acceptors and correlate the device performance with the heterojunction energetics. As a result of a balance between VOC and the photocurrent, tuning of the interface energy gap is necessary to optimize the power conversion efficiency in these devices. In addition, we explore the role of the charge transport layers in the device architecture. It is found that non-fullerene acceptors require adjusted buffer layers with aligned electron transport levels to enable efficient charge extraction, while the insertion of an exciton-blocking layer at the anode interface further boosts photocurrent generation. These adjustments result in a planar-heterojunction OPV device with an efficiency of 6.9% and a VOC above 1 V. (Chemical Equation Presented)},

   abstract = {Nan River Basin contributes about 25 to 40 percent of annual flows in the Lower Chao Phraya River Basin, Thailand. Land use and climate change result in change in meteorological and hydrological conditions in Nan River Basin. In addition, water demand in the basin has been increasing from the economic development. Understanding cross-sectoral interactions from both water resources and economic points of view provides better insight in planning and management. This study proposes an integrated framework of hydrological and economic analysis to assess impacts of water deficits under changing climate and regional development. The objectives of the study are to analyze water supply under climate change scenarios, estimate water demand under economic development scenarios, and assess cross-sectoral impacts of water deficits. A rainfall-runoff model, integrated flood analysis system (IFAS), was calibrated, verified, and used to simulate runoff. Regional input-output model was developed for Nan River Basin to assess economic impacts of water deficits. Analysis of water deficits under climate change scenarios and economic development scenarios was carried out during the period of 2040-2059. Runoff simulations under climate change scenarios using two GCMs, IPSL-CM5A-MR and MIROC5 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 showed increasing trend. Water demand projections of all sectors also showed increasing trend especially in agricultural sector. The uncertainty of water supply under the climate change scenarios is found to be relatively small compare to the uncertainty of water demand under the economic development scenarios. Assessment of indirect economic loss from cross-sectoral analysis is found to be two to three times higher than the direct loss. The results demonstrate the need to consider the indirect economic loss across sectors in water allocation planning and water deficit mitigation policy.},

Excitons, although neutral, may contribute to device currents by diffusing to the junction region where they may be dissociated by the field. A generalized three-particle theory of transport in semiconductors is presented. The results of application of the theory to silicon devices indicate a decrease in the dark saturation current as well as an increase in light-generated current when excitons are incorporated in the theory so long as exciton diffusion length exceeds that of the minority carriers.

   abstract = {<p>The history of the European oil and gas industry reflects local and global political events, economic constraints, and the personal endeavours of individual petroleum geoscientists, as much as it does the development of technologies and the underlying geology of the region. Europe and Europeans played a disproportionately large role in the development of the modern global oil and gas industry. From at least the Iron Age until the 1850s, the use of oil in Europe was limited, and the oil was obtained almost exclusively from surface seeps and mine workings. The use of oil increased in the 1860s with the introduction of new technologies in both production and refining. Shale oil was distilled on a commercial scale in various parts of Europe in the late eighteenth century and throughout the nineteenth century but, in the second half of the nineteenth century, the mineral oils and gas produced primarily from shale and coal could no longer satisfy demand, and oil produced directly from conventional oil fields began to dominate the European market. The first commercial oil wells in Europe were manually dug in Poland in 1853, Romania in 1857, Germany in 1859 and Italy in 1860, before the gradual introduction of mechanical cable drilling rigs started in the early 1860s. In the late nineteenth century, the northern part of the Carpathian Mountains in what is now Poland and Ukraine was one of the most prolific hydrocarbon provinces in the world. The Bóbrka Field in the Carpathian foothills of Poland, discovered in 1853, is still producing and is now the oldest industrial oil field in the world.</p>},

   abstract = {Broadening the optical absorption of organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials by enhancing the intramolecular push-pull effect is a general and effective method to improve the power conversion efficiencies of OPV cells. However, in terms of the electron acceptors, the most common molecular design strategy of halogenation usually results in down-shifted molecular energy levels, thereby leading to decreased open-circuit voltages in the devices. Herein, we report a chlorinated non-fullerene acceptor, which exhibits an extended optical absorption and meanwhile displays a higher voltage than its fluorinated counterpart in the devices. This unexpected phenomenon can be ascribed to the reduced non-radiative energy loss (0.206 eV). Due to the simultaneously improved short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage, a high efficiency of 16.5% is achieved. This study demonstrates that finely tuning the OPV materials to reduce the bandgap-voltage offset has great potential for boosting the efficiency.},

   abstract = {Optimizing the molecular structures of organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials is one of the most effective methods to boost power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). For an excellent molecular system with a certain conjugated skeleton, fine tuning the alky chains is of considerable significance to fully explore its photovoltaic potential. In this work, the optimization of alkyl chains is performed on a chlorinated nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) named BTP-4Cl-BO (a Y6 derivative) and very impressive photovoltaic parameters in OPV cells are obtained. To get more ordered intermolecular packing, the n-undecyl is shortened at the edge of BTP-eC11 to n-nonyl and n-heptyl. As a result, the NFAs of BTP-eC9 and BTP-eC7 are synthesized. The BTP-eC7 shows relatively poor solubility and thus limits its application in device fabrication. Fortunately, the BTP-eC9 possesses good solubility and, at the same time, enhanced electron transport property than BTP-eC11. Significantly, due to the simultaneously enhanced short-circuit current density and fill factor, the BTP-eC9-based single-junction OPV cells record a maximum PCE of 17.8% and get a certified value of 17.3%. These results demonstrate that minimizing the alkyl chains to get suitable solubility and enhanced intermolecular packing has a great potential in further improving its photovoltaic performance.},

However, large-scale solar farms using OPV modules still face great challenges, such as device stability. Herein, the applications of OPV cells in indoor light environments are studied. Via optimizing the active layers to have a good match with the indoor light source, 1 cm2 OPV cells are fabricated and a top PCE of 22% under 1000 lux light-emitting diode (2700 K) illumination is demonstrated. In this work, the light intensities are measured carefully. Incorporated with the external quantum efficiency and photon flux spectrum, the integral current densities of the cells are calculated to confirm the reliability of the photovoltaic measurement. In addition, the devices show much better stability under continuous indoor light illumination. The results suggest that designing wide-bandgap active materials to meet the requirements for the indoor OPV cells has a great potential in achieving higher photovoltaic performance.},

The photovoltaic characterizations reveal a low energy loss below 0.60 eV. As a result, the organic photovoltaic cell (1 cm2) shows a power conversion efficiency of 26.1% with an open-circuit voltage of 1.10 V under a light-emitting diode illumination of 1,000 lux (2,700 K).

Even though several works in literature consider that it remains constant during the system operation, such parameter tends to assume reduced values over time, thus degrading the power that can be extracted from the PV module. It is directly affected by the shunt resistance and, particularly, by the increase of the series resistance due to aging. Besides, it is also influenced by weather conditions, thus causing the corrosion of the PV module cells, manufacturing errors, and “hot spots”. Within this context, this paper analyzes the behavior of the ideality factor as influenced by the series resistance. An analytical expression is also presented, as it is possible to evaluate the behavior of the PV module when the ideality factor is reduced as a direct consequence of the aging process.

However, the reasons for the enhanced performances remain unclear. In this work, we show that defect states play an important, if not dominating, role in improving the OPV performances. The changes in both the density of defect states and the work function of MoO3 with annealing are shown and correlated with the OPV device performance. The increased defect densities improve the OPV performance through an enhanced hole extraction rate at the MoO3/organic interface. The reduction in work function, however, reduces the interface field that can possibly lower mobility near the interface and reduce the electron-blocking effect. This plays a role in saturation of the device performance. This work, therefore, shows the importance of the defects in MoO3 as an ABL and a dominance of defect-enhanced extraction over a field-enhanced extraction process. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

Experimental evidence shows that it is crucial for the photovoltaic performance, as both photocurrent and open circuit voltage directly depend on it. For charge photogeneration, charge transfer complexes represent the intermediate but essential step between exciton dissotiation and charge extraction. Recombination of free charges to the ground state is via the bound charge transfer state before being lost to the ground state. In terms of the open circuit voltage, its maximum achievable value is determined by the energy of the charge transfer state. An important question is whether or not maximum photocurrent and maximum open circuit voltage can be achieved simultaneously. The impact of increasing the CT energy-in order to raise the open circuit voltage, but lowering the kinetic excess energy of the CT complexes at the same time-on the charge photogeneration will accordingly be discussed. Clearly, the fundamental understanding of the processes involving the charge transfer state is essential for an optimisation of the performance of organic solar cells.},

However, if a new technology is prepared to enter a market, other important parameters have to be considered, especially if non-standard PV applications are targeted. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) is a well known but young PV technology of the so called third generation, which offers unique advantages for integrated products such as building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). In this contribution we would like to highlight some of the advantages and challenges which are specific to the application of OPV in the field of building integration. Architectural design features of OPV include the ability to adapt semi-transparency, color and shape of the module. Moreover, glass-laminated OPV modules are deemed suitable for BIPV because of their ease of integration, good fire resistance, high energy harvest per nominal watt-peak and long lifetimes.},

It is found that the present use of a series connection or tunnel junction approach is detrimental to charge-carrier collection in the tandem cells. Each tunnel junction introduced to the solar cell structure decelerates the charge carriers and allows them to recombine at the vicinity of the tunnel junction. The adoption of parallel connections has several advantages over series connections and there is high potential for achieving enhanced efficiencies in third generation tandem solar cells. In these devices, charge carriers are continuously accelerated across the whole device and collected in the external circuit. Multi charge-carrier production and impurity photo-voltaic mechanisms are also built into this system to enhance its performance by increasing the short-circuit current density. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, recent developments in the field of solution-processed multijunction organic solar cells are described. Recently, various strategies have been investigated and implemented to improve the performance of these devices. Next to developing new materials and processing methods for the photoactive and interconnecting layers, specific layers or stacks are designed to increase light absorption and improve the photocurrent by utilizing optical interference effects. These activities have resulted in power conversion efficiencies that approach those of modern thin film photovoltaic technologies. Multijunction cells require more elaborate and intricate characterization procedures to establish their efficiency correctly and a critical view on the results and new insights in this matter are discussed.

It is an important film fabrication method for applications where precise coating is required. A major concern in slot die coating processes is how to determine the operating limits to set the appropriate range of operating parameters, including coating speed, flow rate, vacuum pressure, coating gap, liquid viscosity and surface tension, etc. Operating limits directly determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the process. In this article, the current state of academic research on operating limits in slot die coating processes is reviewed. Specifically, the theories, mechanisms, and empirical conclusions related to the limits on vacuum pressure, the low-flow limit, the limit of wet thickness for zero-vacuum-pressure cases, the limit of dynamic wetting failure, and the limits of coating speed for a specific flow rate are reviewed.

To achieve near-IR absorbing/emitting abilities, strong donor-acceptor interaction and stabilization of the quinoid resonant structure are required. However, due to the smaller one-dimensional quantum well length, bandgap lowering is more difficult and normally requires very strong donor or acceptor units in the case of small molecules. Anthopoulos and Patil showed that the triethylene glycol side chain can enhance molecular self-assembly and increase the FET mobility for DPP-based polymers. Gong applied PS-TPD-PFCB, a commonly used electron-blocking material in light-emitting diodes, in a novel IR photodetector and realized very low dark current and high detection sensitivity.

   abstract = {We describe the detailed synthesis and characterization of an electron-rich building block, dithienopyran (DTP), and its application as a donor unit in low-bandgap conjugated polymers. The electron-donating property of the DTP unit was found to be the strongest among the most frequently used donor units such as benzodithiophene (BDT) or cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) units. When the DTP unit was polymerized with the strongly electron-deficient difluorobenzothiadiazole (DFBT) unit, a regiorandom polymer (PDTP-DFBT, bandgap = 1.38 eV) was obtained. For comparison with the DTP unit, polymers containing alternating benzodithiophene (BDT) or cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) units and the DFBT unit were synthesized (PBDT-DFBT and PCPDT-DFBT). We found that the DTP based polymer PDTP-DFBT shows significantly improved solubility and processability compared to the BDT or CPDT based polymers. Consequently, very high molecular weight and soluble PDTP-DFBT can be obtained with less bulky side chains. Interestingly, PDTP-DFBT shows excellent performance in bulk-heterojunction solar cells with power conversion efficiencies reaching 8.0%, which is significantly higher than PBDT-DFBT and PCPDT-DFBT based devices. This study demonstrates that DTP is a promising building block for high-performance solar cell materials. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

This field-trial exposed modules to very high levels of insolation, in particular in the UV, high temperatures and heavy rainfall. Results show that the modules exhibit practical lifetimes (to degrade by 20% of their initial capacity) of between 2 and 5 months, a value 5-6 times lower than control modules kept both in the dark and outdoors in Roskilde, Denmark. Degradation was primarily the result of extensive delamination caused by failure of the non-UV stable encapsulation, which led to decay in the FF, Voc and Isc of the module.},

In spite of the impressive development achieved throughout these years, especially in terms of reported power conversion efficiencies, there are still important technological and fundamental obstacles to circumvent before they can be implemented into reliable and long-lasting applications. Regarding device processing, the synthesis of highly soluble polymeric semiconductors first, and fullerene derivatives then, was initially considered as an important breakthrough that would definitely change the fabrication of photovoltaics once for all. Nowadays, the promise of printing solar cells by low-cost and high throughput mass production techniques still stands. However, the potential and the expectation raised by this technology is such that it is considerably difficult to keep track of the most significant progresses being now published in different and even monographic journals. There is therefore the need to compile the most remarkable advances in well-documented reviews than can be used as a reference for future ideas and works. In this letter, we review the development of polymeric solar cells from its origin to the most efficient devices published to date. After analyzing their fundamental limits, we separate these achievements into three different categories traditionally followed by the scientific community to push devices over 10% power conversion efficiency: Active materials, strategies -fabrication/processing procedures- that can mainly modify the active film morphology and result in improved efficiencies for the same starting materials, and all the different cell layout/architectures that have been used in order to extract as high photocurrent as possible from the Sun. The synthesis of new donors and acceptors, the use of additives and post-processing techniques, buffer interlayers, inverted and tandem designs are some of the most important aspects that are in detailed reviewed in this letter. All have equally contributed to develop this technology and leave it at doors of commercialization.},

   abstract = {High-level nuclear waste in the United States comprises large volumes (tens of millions of cubic meters), high total activities (billions of Curies) and highly diverse and complex compositions. The principal sources of nuclear waste are: (i) spent nuclear fuel from commercial and research nuclear reactors; (ii) liquid waste produced during the reprocessing of commercial spent nuclear fuel; (iii) waste generated by the nuclear weapons and naval propulsion programs. The latter category now includes over 100 metric tons of plutonium and many hundreds of tons of highly enriched uranium from the dismantling of nuclear weapons. Most of these wastes will require chemical treatment, processing and solidification into waste forms for permanent disposal. The long-term effects of radiation on waste form solids is a critical concern in the performance assessment of the long-term containment strategy. In the case of spent nuclear fuel, the radiation dose due to the in-reactor neutron irradiation is already substantial, and additional damage accumulation during disposal is not anticipated to be significant; thus, this is not a subject addressed in this review paper. In contrast, the post-disposal radiation damage to waste form glasses and crystalline ceramics is significant. The cumulative α-decay doses which are projected for nuclear waste glasses reach values of 1016 α-decays g-1 in 100 yr. Similarly, crystalline waste forms, such as Synroc will reach values of > 1018 α-decay events g-1 in 1000 yr for a 20 wt% waste loading. These doses are well within the range for which important changes in the physical and chemical properties may occur, e.g. the transition from the crystalline-to-aperiodic state in ceramics. This paper provides a comprehensive review of radiation effects (due to γ-, β- and α-decay events, as well as from actinide doping experiments and particle irradiations) on nuclear waste form glasses and crystalline ceramics, particularly Synroc phases, zircon, apatite, monazite and titanite.

However, compared to inorganic-based photodetectors, OPD devices have shown noticeably higher dark current and relatively lower sensitivity which is critical when the sensor needs to detect signals under low illumination intensities. Thus, to improve the design of OPDs, it is very important to know how opto-electrical response of the device is limited under the influences of structure, contact, and material layer properties. To analyze such limits, we employ a drift-diffusion approach to simulate a well-known and well-reproducible organic-based photodiode structure. Good agreement between current-voltage characteristics of the simulated result and experimental measurements under different illumination intensities confirms the presence of the traps is the origin of the high dark current in OPD devices. In addition, it is shown that traps have a dominant influence on the current-voltage characteristics of the device at low intensities, critical issue in several applications such as indirect X-ray detection technology. Based on this paper, to enhance OPD device performance operating in low intensities, it is recommended to put effort into processing (designing) a trap-free structure (material), rather than improving the material layer, structure, and contact properties.},

Accordingly, blends with the donor polymer PBDB-T exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 12.4%. Further improvements in efficiency are found upon backbone fluorination of the donor polymer to afford the novel material PFBDB-T. The resulting blend with C8-ITIC shows an impressive PCE up to 13.2% as a result of the higher open-circuit voltage. Electroluminescence studies demonstrate that backbone fluorination reduces the energy loss of the blends, with PFBDB-T/C8-ITIC-based cells exhibiting a small energy loss of 0.6 eV combined with a high JSC of 19.6 mA cm−2.},

   abstract = {Organic electronics is an emerging technology with numerous applications in which the active layer is composed of an organic semiconductor (OSC) or blends of multiple OSC. One of the key performance parameters for such devices is the charge carrier mobility which can be evaluated by different measurement techniques. Here, we review different formalisms for extraction and analysis of hole mobilities from temperature-dependent space-charge limited conductivity (SCLC) measurements for pristine OSC as well as for binary and ternary blends as used in e.g. photovoltaic applications. The model is also applicable to n-type materials. Possible sources of measurement errors, such as the presence of traps and series resistance, are discussed. We show that by a simple method of selecting a proper experimental data range these errors can be avoided. The Murgatroyd-Gill analytical model in combination with the Gaussian Disorder Model is used to extract zero-field hole mobilities as well as estimates of the Gaussian energetic disorder in the HOMO level from experimental data. The resulting mobilities are in excellent agreement with those found from more elaborate fits to a full drift-diffusion model that includes a temperature, field and density dependent charge carrier mobility; the same holds for the Gaussian disorder of pure materials and blends with low fullerene concentration. The zero-field mobilities are also analyzed according to an Arrhenius model that was previously argued to reveal a universal mobility law; for most –but not all– material systems in the present work this framework gave an equally good fit to the experimental data as the other models. An automated fitting freeware, incorporating the different models, is made openly available for download and minimizes error, user input and SCLC data analysis time; e.g. SCLC current-voltage curves at several different temperatures can be globally fitted in a few seconds.},

Our results reveal that the quality of the bulk material plays an important role in the electrical conduction mechanism of the devices with the side length larger than 1 mm of the photosensitive area.},

   abstract = {In this paper, the optimization, elaboration and characterization of an efficient spectral beam splitter based on a simple RF sputtered ITO/Ag/ITO (IAI) ultra-thin multilayer structure are presented. An experimental investigation assisted by Genetic Algorithm (GA) metaheuristic optimization was carried out to achieve high-performance spectral splitter for tandem solar cell applications. The RF magnetron sputtering method was used to elaborate the optimized IAI structure. The optical and structural properties of the sputtered splitter were also analyzed using UV–Vis-IR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. It is found that the elaborated splitter structure offers 84% of transparency and a high reflectance of 87% with an optimum cut-off wavelength of 800 nm. This is attributed to the design approach, which leads to promote spectral splitting mechanism by inducing efficient optical modulation. Interestingly, a new Figure of Merit (FoM) parameter, which evaluates the optical splitting performances is proposed. Moreover, a new Perovskite/InGaAs tandem cell is proposed and analyzed to show the impact of the elaborated spectrum splitter on the solar cell efficiency. It is revealed that the investigated solar cell exhibits an improved efficiency approaching 30%. The latter value far surpasses that provided by Perovskite tandem cells. These results indicate that our spectrum splitting approach can open a new pathway towards designing high-performance tandem photovoltaic devices.},

   abstract = {Temperature-activated charge transport in disordered organic semiconductors at large carrier concentrations, especially relevant in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), has been thoroughly considered using a recently developed analytical formalism assuming a Gaussian density-of-states (DOS) distribution and Miller-Abrahams jump rates. We demonstrate that the apparent Meyer-Neldel compensation rule (MNR) is recovered regarding the temperature dependences of the charge carrier mobility upon varying the carrier concentration but not regarding varying the width of the DOS. We show that establishment of the MNR is a characteristic signature of hopping transport in a random system with variable carrier concentration. The polaron formation was not involved to rationalize this phenomenon. The MNR effect has been studied in a OFET based on C60 films, a material with negligible electron-phonon coupling, and successfully described by the present model. We show that this phenomenon is entirely due to the evolution of the occupational DOS profile upon increasing carrier concentration and this mechanism is specific to materials with Gaussian-shaped DOS. The suggested model provides compact analytical relations which can be readily used for the evaluation of important material parameters from experimentally accessible data on temperature dependence of the mobility in organic electronic devices. Experimental results on temperature-dependent charge mobility reported before for organic semiconductors by other authors can be well interpreted by using the model presented in this paper. In addition, the presented analytical formalism predicts a transition to a Mott-type charge carrier hopping regime at very low temperatures, which also manifests a MNR effect. © 2010 The American Physical Society.},

However, the number of solar cells being produced yearly (in terms of watts produced by these solar cells under a standardized spectrum) has been growing consistently over the last 10 years, with growth rates between 25 and 70%/year; for 2005 solar cell production reached 1.7GW. This terrestrial photovoltaic (PV) market is currently dominated by flat plate modules incorporating Si solar cells. However, to sustain the present growth rate of terrestrial PV, the use of expensive semiconductor material must be minimized, necessitating the development of new technologies. According to all energy scenarios for the coming decades, made up by leading instances (e.g. White Paper European Commission), energy agencies (e.g. International Energy Agency) and R&D institutions the part of renewable energy sources within future energy generation schemes is expected to grow. Such growth is a necessary condition to counter problems related to the exhaustion of fossil energy sources (mainly oil) and to CO 2 emissions, and to tackle the difficulties associated with a further build-up of nuclear capacity. Nowadays the part of renewable energy sources within the energy supply consists mainly of hydropower and wind energy, the latter becoming increasingly important. However, the number of solar cells being produced yearly (in terms of Watts produced by these solar cells under a standardized spectrum) is growing consistently the last 10 years with growth rates between 25 up to 70%/year, and for 2005 the yearly production of solar cells has reached 1.7GW.This terrestrial photo-voltaic (PV) market is currently dominated by flat plate modules incorporating Si solar cells. However, in order to sustain the present growth rate of terrestrial photovoltaics, the use of expensive semiconductor material must be minimized, necessitating the development of new technologies. A very promising approach to increase the conversion efficiency is the use of high-efficiency multi-junction photovoltaic stacks.The basic idea of multi-junction photovoltaic devices is to use a stack of different materials (with different bandgaps) such that every solar cell in the stack absorbs part of the incident spectrum. By choosing a suitable combination of bandgaps for the different materials, this results in an improvement of the conversion efficiency over the single junction approach. The present state-of-the-art consists of a triple-junction cell, made by depositing InGaP and GaAs cells lattice-matched on a Ge substrate.A Ge cell is realized during deposition.The resulting triple-junction InGaP/GaAs/Ge cells have average production conversion efficiencies of approximately 30% (AM1.5).These cells are currently mainly being used for power generation in space applications, where their high efficiency and low weight make them the preferred},

   abstract = {The Shockley equation (SE), originally derived to describe a p-n junction, has been frequently used in the past to simulate current-voltage (j/V) characteristics of organic solar cells (OSC). In order to gain a more detailed understanding of recombination losses, we determined the SE parameters, i.e., the ideality factor and the dark saturation current, from temperature dependent static j/V measurements on poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C 61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) bulk heterojunction solar cells. As we show here, these parameters are directly related to charge-carrier recombination and become also accessible by transient photovoltage and photocurrent methods in the case of field-independent charge-carrier generation. Although determined in very different ways, both SE parameters were found to be identical. The good agreement of static and transient approaches over a wide temperature range demonstrates the validity of the Shockley model for OSC based on material systems satisfying the requirement of field-independent polaron-pair dissociation. In particular, we were able to reproduce the photocurrent at various light intensities and temperatures from the respective nongeminate recombination rates. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the dark saturation current j 0 allowed determining the effective band gap of the photoactive blend perfectly agreeing with the literature values of the energy onset of the photocurrent due to charge transfer absorption. We also present a consistent model directly relating the ideality factor to recombination of free with trapped charge carriers in an exponential density of tail states. We verify this finding by data from thermally stimulated current measurements. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

This makes them attractive for markets in which other technologies cannot compete, for example in architectural and consumer product integration. However, both efficiencies and long term operational stability of OSCs do not yet meet the standards set by their inorganic counterparts. This review compiles the growing knowledge about how nanostructured carbon materials, such as fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, decisively influence the operational stability of organic photovoltaics. Firstly, important degradation pathways are introduced and a differential detection scheme is set up to find the dominant loss channel by means of state-of-the-art characterization methods. Then, fullerenes ability to both stabilize and destabilize the donor polymer against photooxidation via different mechanisms (e.g., inner filter effect or radical scavenging) is examined in detail. The “burn-in” problem, an initial rapid efficiency loss in PC60BM-based OSCs, is shown to derive from light-induced PC60BM dimerization, an effect that can also be positively exploited to reduce thermal degradation. Finally, thermal stabilization via additional approaches involving the fullerene derivative, such as crosslinking or incorporation into block copolymers, is presented.},

This assessment takes an engineering-based approach to assessing the potential future cost of each component of OPV modules, as well as the future scale of OPV production plants and associated scale economies, using stochastic analysis to account for uncertainty. The analysis suggests that OPV module costs could fall within a (interquartile) range of US 0.23–0.34/Wp, with a median cost estimate of US 0.28/Wp in the near-term, with future costs most sensitive to manufacturing scale, cell efficiency and module fill factor. This compares to a projected range of module costs for more established PV technologies (crystalline silicon, cadmium telluride and copper indium gallium selenide) of US 0.35–0.6/Wp by 2020. In levelised cost of electricity terms, OPV could compete with the established technologies in both roof- and ground-mounted systems if it can achieve a 10-year lifetime.},

In good accordance with experimental observations, a negative temperature coefficient of order dVoc/dT≈-1 mV K-1 is obtained at temperatures higher than a critical value Tc, which signals the transition between high- to low-occupancy conditions. This temperature dependence is valid for carriers obeying Boltzmann statistics at low-occupancy level, in similarity to that occurring for inorganic solar cells. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Space charge regions inside the semiconductor produce a variation of the conductive volume when carriers are photogenerated.

Here, multiterminal devices measured as functions of two load variables are characterized unambiguously as functions of three device voltages or currents on hexagonal plots. We demonstrate these measurement techniques using two GaInP/GaAs tandem solar cells, with a middle contact between the two subcells, as example 3T devices with both series-connected and reverse-connected subcells. Coupling mechanisms between the subcells are quantified within the context of a simple equivalent optoelectronic circuit. Electrical and optical coupling mechanisms are most clearly revealed using coupled dark measurements. These measurements are sensitive enough to observe very small luminescent coupling from the bottom subcell to the top subcell in the prototype 3T device. Quick simplified measurement techniques are also discussed within the context of the complete characterization.},

   abstract = {A detailed description of a setup for studying ageing of polymer devices is presented. The system offers individual control of the environmental factors (oxygen, humidity, atmosphere, temperature and light intensity) causing the degradation of organic devices. The system was developed for accurate control of the conditions and data collection of photovoltaic (PV) parameters for organic solar cells during long-term testing. The atmosphere chamber can operate under vacuum conditions without temperature control. It is designed for operation at an internal gas pressure of around 1 atm. It is further equipped for isotopic labeling experiments of the internal atmosphere (18O2 and H218O) such that degradation mechanisms can be studied using TOF-SIMS as a chemical probe. Experiments on both "accelerated" (by applying thermal stress to the devices) and "long-term" lifetime measurements of traditional organic bulk heterojunction solar cell devices have been realized while controlling the environmental conditions. As an example of use of the setup we determined the acceleration factor for standard bulk heterojunction devices based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT-[60]PCBM/Al when operated under an ambient atmosphere and under an inert atmosphere at temperatures of 25, 43, 63 and 83 °C. Different values for the acceleration factor were found depending on the atmosphere used and further our results suggest that the acceleration factor may change in time as different degradation mechanisms may dominate at different times during the device life. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Although non-fullerene small molecular acceptors (NF-SMAs) are dominating current research in organic solar cells (OSCs), measurements of thermodynamics drivers and kinetic factors determining their morphological stability are lacking. Here, we delineate and measure such factors in crystallizable NF-SMA blends and discuss four model systems with respect to their meta-stability and degree of vitrification. We determine for the first time the amorphous-amorphous phase diagram in an NF-SMA system and show that its deep quench depth can result in severe burn-in degradation. We estimate the relative phase behavior of four other materials systems. Additionally, we derive room-temperature diffusion coefficients and conclude that the morphology needs to be stabilized by vitrification corresponding to diffusion constants below 10−22 cm2/s. Our results show that to achieve stability via rational molecular design, the thermodynamics, glass transition temperature, diffusion properties, and related structure-function relations need to be more extensively studied and understood. In recent years, the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) has greatly improved with the development of novel non-fullerene small molecular acceptors (NF-SMA). The rapid increase in power conversion efficiency, now surpassing 15%, highlights an immediate and increasing need to understand the longevity and lifetime of NF-OSCs. However, the field relies mainly on a laborious trial-and-error approach to select polymer:NF-SMA pairs with desirable device stability. Here, we provide a structure-property relation that explains the morphological stability and burn-in degradation due to excessive demixing or crystallization. The framework presented in our study shows that a specific balance of interactions between polymer and NF-SMA can offer a short-term solution against excessive demixing. Long-term morphological stability that also suppresses crystallization can only be achieved by freezing in the initial quenched morphology through the use of polymers and/or NF-SMAs with low flexibility. This research provides a structure-property relation that sheds light on morphological stability of NF-OSCs by using the thermodynamic and the kinetic perspectives. We show that NF-OSCs can suffer from excessive amorphous-amorphous phase separation in the blends and crystallization of NF-SMA. The former instability channel can be eliminated in systems with an optimal miscibility, whereas the excessive phase separation in low miscibility systems and NF-SMA crystallization need to be suppressed through the utilization of polymers or NF-SMAs with low flexibility.},

   abstract = {In this paper, comprehensive study on variation in composition ratio and thermal annealing of multilayer organic solar cells (OSC) has been demonstrated. Our previous work reported that in comparison to the conventional OSC structure, multilayer OSC consisting of the pure donor phase between the hole transport layer and active layer has shown a significant improvement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Since photovoltaic performance of the OSC strongly influenced by composition ratio, the impact of poly 3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) and 6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) weight ratio has been analyzed. It has been found that, the short-circuit current density (JSC) of the device is highest for the P3HT:PCBM composition ratio of 1.0:0.8 and decreases slightly for 1.0:1.0 weight ratio. This study has also been accompanied with the thermal annealing on spin coated P3HT:PCBM which further enhances the PCE of the device. The maximum JSC and the PCE of 9.47 mA/cm2 and 3.26% has been achieved for the multilayer OSC having P3HT:PCBM composition ratio of 1.0:0.8 and thermally annealed at 140 °C. This is attributed largely by the tuned phase morphology of the donor-acceptor. It has been found that, the P3HT:PCBM weight ratio of 1.0:0.8 results into efficient photon absorption and charge separation in the bulk heterojunction OSC. The reduced concentration of PCBM in 1.0:0.8 weight ratio leads to the strong interchain interaction of P3HT molecules which enhances the charge separation and collection ability of the bulk heterojunction OSC.},

   abstract = {Negative index metamaterials have revolutionized the field of photonics because of their unconventional electromagnetic properties absent in naturally occurring materials. It remains a challenge however, to achieve strong negative refractive index at optical frequencies over large areas in a device compatible fashion. In this work, a scalable method for the straightforward production of fishnet-like negative index metamaterials combining soft nanoimprinting and electrodeposition is reported. In four simple steps, 2D arrays of pillars surrounded by metal–insulator–metal stacks made of gold and air gaps are created. The proper design of the geometrical features leads to negative indices from the visible to the near infrared, with values from -1.2 at 700 nm to -2.8 at 910 nm. The metamaterials are prepared on transparent conductive electrodes hence ready for device implementation. In addition, the nanostructures display high optical quality, which is corroborated with numerical simulations under normal and oblique incidence. As a proof of concept, the accessibility to the porosity of the metamaterial by studying the spectral changes produced when infiltrating different liquids through the metallic layers is demonstrated. The resonant wavelength increasing with the refractive index of the media makes the metamaterials potential platforms for both negative index structures and optical sensors.},

Separate benchmark indicators are calculated for the energy efficiency of natural gas, oil and coal-fired power generation, based on weighted-average energy efficiencies. These indicators are aggregated to an overall benchmark for fossil-fired power generation. The weighted average efficiencies are 35% for coal, 45% for natural gas and 38% for oil-fired power generation.

What is becoming clear as the industry develops is that area-related costs, such as costs of encapsulation and field-installation, are increasingly important components of the total costs of photovoltaic electricity generation, with this trend expected to continue. Improved energy-conversion efficiency directly reduces such costs, with increased manufacturing volume likely to drive down the additional costs associated with implementing higher efficiencies. This suggests the industry will evolve beyond the standard single-junction solar cells that currently dominate commercial production, where energy-conversion efficiencies are fundamentally constrained by Shockley-Queisser limits to practical values below 30%. This Review assesses the overall prospects for a range of approaches that can potentially exceed these limits, based on ultimate efficiency prospects, material requirements and developmental outlook.},

   abstract = {A new photodiode fabrication strategy for organic photodiodes is proposed, involving the use of a small amount of cationic surfactant in a blend solution aiming at synergetic effects of facile device fabrication and high performances. By adding a small amount of cationic surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)) to a blend solution consisting of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM), the indium tin oxide (ITO) work function can be reduced to ∼4.55 eV due to the formation of a CTAB dipole layer, without the insertion of oxide buffer layers. Furthermore, we observe a meaningful contribution of the addition of CTAB to the morphology of the active layer in terms of the intermiscibility between P3HT and PC60BM. Various photophysical, morphological, and structural analyses provided strong evidence for the enhanced intermiscibility between P3HT and PC60BM. Owing to the synergetic contribution of CTAB, the resulting photodiode with inverted diode geometry reveals a high detectivity of ∼2.5 × 1012 Jones based on a low dark current of 1.3 × 10-8 A/cm2 at -1 V. In addition, a high -3 dB frequency of 4 kHz and a linear dynamic range of 100 dB are demonstrated. This work opens the possibility of facile and simple photodiode patterning/printing processes.},

All the atmospheric CO2 is cycled through plants every 300 yr, all the O2 every 2000 yr and all the H2O every 2 million yr. The magnitude and role of photosynthesis is largely unrecognized principally because we utilize such a small fraction of the fixed carbon and because we do not realize the important recycling phenomena. Fortunately for us plants are very adaptable and exist in great diversity-they could thus continue indefinitely to supply us with renewable quantities of food, fibre, fuel and chemicals. Photosynthesis in the past provided all our fossil carbon resources. It now seems time that we recognize seriously and evaluate what photosynthesis can do for us in the future via traditional and non-conventional mechanisms, e.g. H2 production, carbon fixation. © 1979.},

   abstract = {Superstrate solar cells were prepared by thermal evaporation of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 onto ZnO coated glass substrates. For the first time, photo-conversion efficiencies above 11% were reached without the necessity of additional light soaking or forward biasing of the solar cell. This was achieved by modifying the deposition process as well as the sodium doping. Limitations of the superstrate device configuration and possible ways to overcome these were investigated by analyzing the hetero-interface with electron microscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurements, combined with capacitance spectroscopy and device simulations. A device model was derived that explains how on the one hand the GaOx, which forms at the CIGSe/ZnO interface, reduces the interface recombination. On the other hand how it limits the efficiency by acting as an electron barrier at the hetero-interface presumably because of a high density of negatively charged acceptor states like CuGa. The addition of sodium enhances the p-type doping of the absorber but also increases the net doping within the GaOx. Hence, a trade-off between these two effects is required. The conversion efficiency was found to decrease over time, which can be explained in our model by field-induced diffusion of sodium cations out from the GaOx layer. The proposed device model is able to explain various effects frequently observed upon light soaking and forward biasing of superstrate devices.},

Films are characterized by spectroscopic ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and far ultraviolet reflectometry. For substrate temperatures of 150 &deg;C and greater, films showed significant microroughness with a correlated reduction in effective refractive index. This behavior was mitigated by a reduction in substrate temperature to as low as 100 &deg;C. Films deposited on silicon substrates were subjected to long-term storage testing to evaluate the environmental sensitivity of the deposited layers. Protected aluminum mirrors were also fabricated with ALD LiF overcoats, yielding a reflectance of 84% at a wavelength of 125 nm. The performance relative to state-of-the-art LiF thin films deposited by physical vapor deposition methods is discussed, along with the prospects for future optimization.},

   abstract = {Unsteady liquid film flow on a rotating disc is analyzed by a asymptotic methods for low and high Reynolds numbers. The analysis elucidates how a film of uniform thickness thins when the disc is set in steady rotation. In the low Reynolds number analysis two time scales for the thinning film are identified. The long time scale analysis ignores the initial acceleration of the fluid layer and hence is singular at the onset of rotation. The singularity is removed by matching the long time scale expansion for the transient film thickness with a short time scale expansion that accounts for fluid acceleration during spinup. The leading orde term in the long time scale solution for the transient film thickness is shown to be a lower bound for film thickness for all time. A short time analysis that account for boundary layer growth at the disc surface is also presented for arbitrary Reynolds number. The analysis becomes invalid either when the boundary layer has a thickness comparable to that of the thinning film, or when nonlinear effects become important. (A)},

   abstract = {This paper considers intrinsic loss processes that lead to fundamental limits in solar cell efficiency. Five intrinsic loss processes are quantified, accounting for all incident solar radiation. An analytical approach is taken to highlight physical mechanisms, obscured in previous numerical studies. It is found that the free energy available per carrier is limited by a Carnot factor resulting from the conversion of thermal energy into entropy free work, a Boltzmann factor arising from the mismatch between absorption and emission angles and also carrier thermalisation. It is shown that in a degenerate band absorber, a free energy advantage is achieved over a discrete energy level absorber due to entropy transfer during carrier cooling. The non-absorption of photons with energy below the bandgap and photon emission from the device are shown to be current limiting processes. All losses are evaluated using the same approach providing a complete mathematical and graphical description of intrinsic mechanisms leading to limiting efficiency. Intrinsic losses in concentrator cells and spectrum splitting devices are considered and it is shown that dominant intrinsic losses are theoretically avoidable with novel device designs. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {Polymer:fullerene solar cells are demonstrated with power conversion efficiencies over 7% with blends of PBDTTPD and PC61BM. These devices achieve open-circuit voltages (Voc) of 0.945 V and internal quantum efficiencies of 88%, making them an ideal candidate for the large bandgap junction in tandem solar cells. Voc’s above 1.0 V are obtained when the polymer is blended with multiadduct fullerenes; however, the photocurrent and fill factor are greatly reduced. In PBDTTPD blends with multiadduct fullerene ICBA, fullerene emission is observed in the photoluminescence and electroluminescence spectra, indicating that excitons are recombining on ICBA. Voltage-dependent, steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements indicate that energy transfer occurs from PBDTTPD to ICBA and that back hole transfer from ICBA to PBDTTPD is inefficient. By analyzing the absorption and emission spectra from fullerene and charge transfer excitons, we estimate a driving free energy of –0.14 ± 0.06 eV is required for efficient hole transfer. These results suggest that the driving force for hole transfer may be too small for efficient current generation in polymer:fullerene solar cells with Voc values above 1.0 V and that non-fullerene acceptor materials with large optical gaps (>1.7 eV) may be required to achieve both near unity internal quantum efficiencies and values of Voc exceeding 1.0 V.},

   abstract = {Future scenarios with significant anthropogenic climate change also display large increases in world production of fossil fuels, the principal CO2 emission source. Meanwhile, fossil fuel depletion has also been identified as a future challenge. This chapter reviews the connection between these two issues and concludes that limits to availability of fossil fuels will set a limit for mankind's ability to affect the climate. However, this limit is unclear as various studies have reached quite different conclusions regarding future atmospheric CO2 concentrations caused by fossil fuel limitations. It is concluded that the current set of emission scenarios used by the IPCC and others is perforated by optimistic expectations on future fossil fuel production that are improbable or even unrealistic. The current situation, where climate models largely rely on emission scenarios detached from the reality of supply and its inherent problems are problematic. In fact, it may even mislead planners and politicians into making decisions that mitigate one problem but make the other one worse. It is important to understand that the fossil energy problem and the anthropogenic climate change problem are tightly connected and need to be treated as two interwoven challenges necessitating a holistic solution. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Existing PV panels have a relatively low and varying output voltage so that the converter installed between the PVs and the grid should be equipped with high step-up and versatile control capabilities. In addition, the output current of PV systems is rich in harmonics which affect the power quality of the grid. In this paper, a new multi-stage hysteresis control of a step-up DC-DC converter is proposed for integrating PVs into a single-phase power grid. The proposed circuitry and control method is experimentally validated by testing on a 600W prototype converter. The developed technology has significant economic implications and could be applied to many distributed generation (DG) systems, especially for the developing countries which have a large number of small PVs connected to their single-phase distribution network. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Semi-transparent organic photovoltaic (ST-OPV) cells are regarded as an attractive solution to building-integrated solar energy harvesting. Both the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average photopic transmission (APT) of ST-OPVs have shown substantial increases in recent years. However, less attention has been paid to the area scaling of ST-OPV cells. In this work, we investigate the scalability of ST-OPV cells from 4 mm2 to 1 cm2, as well as 9 cm2 active area prototype module. By integrating both top and bottom metal grids onto the transparent electrodes, the series resistance loss of 1 cm2 ST-OPV cell is significantly reduced, and is comparable to that of the grid-free 4 mm2 cell. Nine 1 cm2 cells are then connected in a series-parallel circuit to realize a prototype ST-OPV module. A 100% fabrication yield with only 5% PCE deviation among discrete cells is achieved. The semitransparent module shows PCE = 7.2 ± 0.1% under simulated AM 1.5G illumination at 1 sun intensity, which exhibits no connection resistance loss compared to that of the individual cells. The ST-OPV module exhibits an APT = 38.1 ± 1.1%, which enables a light utilization efficiency, LUE = 2.74 ± 0.09%. The method demonstrates a promising way for ST-OPV modules to scale without compromising performance.},

   abstract = {Spectral splitting is a promising design methodology that can significantly improve the performance of hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PV-T) collectors. However, conventional spectral-splitting PVT (SSPVT) collectors require additional optical components, which significantly increases the complexity and cost of the collector. This study proposes SSPVT collector designs that employ semi-transparent photovoltaic (PV) solar cells, which act as both the electricity generator as well as the spectral-splitting optical filter. In these designs, a part of the solar spectrum is absorbed by the semi-transparent solar cells for electricity generation, while the rest (especially the near-infrared region of the solar spectrum) is transmitted to an absorber where it generates a high-temperature thermal energy output. Three types of emerging semi-transparent solar cells, i.e., cadmium telluride (CdTe), perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs), are selected for investigation in this context. A comprehensive two-dimensional model of such SSPVT collectors is developed and used to investigate their electrical and thermal performance. The results show that the proposed designs are effective at thermally decoupling the PV cells from the solar thermal absorber, thereby promoting a higher electrical efficiency and enabling the simultaneous generation of low-temperature thermal energy (<60 °C), along with high-temperature thermal energy (100–200 °C) under one sun. For example, a PVSC-based SSPVT collector is shown to be capable of simultaneously generating: electricity with an efficiency of 13.8%, high-temperature heat (150 °C) with a thermal efficiency of 21.1%, and low-temperature heat (50 °C) with a thermal efficiency of 22.5%. The relative performance between the CdTe-, PVSC- and PSC-based collectors depend on the relative value of the high-temperature thermal energy to that of electricity. It is concluded that semi-transparent solar cells are of great promise in this application, and can give rise to next-generation, high-performance solar collectors.},

   abstract = {A quantitative theory for the shapes of the absorption bands of F-centres is given on the basis of the Franck-Condon principle. Underlying the treatment are two simplifying assumptions: namely, (a) that the lattice can be approximately treated as a dielectric continuum; (b) that in obtaining the vibrational wave functions for the lattice, the effect of the F-centre can be considered as that of a static charge distribution. Under these assumptions, it is shown that the absorption constant as a function of frequency and temperature can be expressed in terms of the Bessel functions with imaginary arguments. The theoretical curves for the absorption constant compare very favourably with the experimental curves for all temperatures. Also considered in the paper are the probabilities of non-radiative transitions, which are important in connexion with the photo-conductivity observed following light absorption by F-centres. The treatment given differs from the qualitative considerations hitherto in one important aspect, namely, the strength of the coupling between the electron and the lattice is taken into account. The adiabatic wave functions for the F-centre electron required for the discussion are obtained by perturbation methods. The probability for an excited F-centre to return to its ground state by non-radiative transitions is shown to be negligible; similar transitions to the conduction band are, however, important if the excited state is separated from the conduction band by not much more than 0$\cdot $1 eV. The temperature dependence of such transitions is complicated, but, for a wide range of temperatures, resembles e$^\{-W/kT\}$. Tentative estimates show that the result is consistent with the observed steep drop of the photo-conductive current with temperature.},

The transient response for OPD rise- A nd fall-time is in the μs regime, with an on/off-ratio of four orders of magnitude at - 2 V bias. The rise of responsivity is tunable by increasing the absorption layer thickness and shows a dependency in relation to dark current and transient response.},

Applications in biomedicine, education, environmental monitoring, optical communications, pharmaceutics and machine vision are also driving the development of imaging technologies. Organic photodiodes (OPDs) are now being investigated for existing imaging technologies, as their properties make them interesting candidates for these applications. OPDs offer cheaper processing methods, devices that are light, flexible and compatible with large (or small) areas, and the ability to tune the photophysical and optoelectronic properties − both at a material and device level. Although the concept of OPDs has been around for some time, it is only relatively recently that significant progress has been made, with their performance now reaching the point that they are beginning to rival their inorganic counterparts in a number of performance criteria including the linear dynamic range, detectivity, and color selectivity. This review covers the progress made in the OPD field, describing their development as well as the challenges and opportunities.},

   abstract = {The power conversion efficiency of the most efficient organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells has recently increased to over 10%. To enable further increases, the factors limiting the device efficiency in OPV must be identified. In this review, the operational mechanism of OPV cells is explained and the detailed balance limit to photovoltaic energy conversion, as developed by Shockley and Queisser, is outlined. The various approaches that have been developed to estimate the maximum practically achievable efficiency in OPV are then discussed, based on empirical knowledge of organic semiconductor materials. Subsequently, approaches made to adapt the detailed balance theory to incorporate some of the fundamentally different processes in organic solar cells that originate from using a combination of two complementary, donor and acceptor, organic semiconductors using thermodynamic and kinetic approaches are described. The more empirical formulations to the efficiency limits provide estimates of 10-12%, but the more fundamental descriptions suggest limits of 20-24% to be reachable in single junctions, similar to the highest efficiencies obtained for crystalline silicon p-n junction solar cells. Closing this gap sets the stage for future materials research and development of OPV. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

   abstract = {The asymmetric behavior in the dark current of any solar cell is essential for decoupling recombination and charge extraction for efficient charge collection. Therefore current density dependence on applied voltage can be used to investigate the complex interplay between bulk charge transport, interface exchange effects and recombination mechanisms. In the present work, we investigate from dark current–density [J(V)] of bulk heterojunction solar cells, the dependence of mobility and charge injection mechanisms on different blend layer thicknesses. The active layer thickness has been established through varying the spin-coating speeds between 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 revolutions per minute (rpm) and confirmed by a dektak surface profilometer. The carrier mobility (μ) as a factor limiting the efficiency of organic solar cells was investigated from dark space charge limited current and trap free space charge limited current conduction mechanisms to distinguish between charge extraction and recombination. This approach allows the determination of the effects of threshold field through variation of the active layer thickness (ALT) on the potential barrier height (ϕB) at the electrode contacts. Low values of charge carrier mobilities (10–6 cm2 V−1 s−1) in the trap free space charge limited current conduction region have been correlated to the Langevin recombination constants. In the ohmic region, the highest dark carrier mobility corresponded to the 77.1 nm ALT. Further we observe a shift in the transition voltage at the inflection point of J–V curves with increasing film thickness in the forward bias.},

And the effects of the solar brightness distribution and optical errors (e.g., alignment error and tracking error) are also involved. Furthermore, the spectral distribution of the solar radiation is illustrated with the beam splitting filter, which has been specially designed using the needle optimization method. It is shown that using the filter the heat load of the cell can be reduced by 20.7%, up to 10.5% of the total incident solar energy can be recovery by the receiver, and the overall optical efficiency in theory is about 0.764. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

However, the limited exploitation of basic properties makes it difficult for devices to stand out. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid heterostructure with ultrathin vanadium dioxide film and molybdenum ditelluride nanoflake. Vanadium dioxide is a classical semiconductor with a narrow bandgap, a high temperature coefficient of resistance, and phase transformation. Molybdenum ditelluride, a typical two-dimensional material, is often used to construct optoelectronic devices. The heterostructure can realize three different functional modes: (i) the p–n junction exhibits ultrasensitive detection (450 nm–2 μm) with a dark current down to 0.2 pA and a response time of 17 μs, (ii) the Schottky junction works stably under extreme conditions such as a high temperature of 400 K, and (iii) the bolometer shows ultrabroad spectrum detection exceeding 10 μm. The flexible switching between the three modes makes the heterostructure a potential candidate for next-generation photodetectors from visible to longwave infrared radiation (LWIR).

   abstract = {To quantify the potential value of technological advances to the photovoltaics (PV) sector, this paper examines the impact of changes to key PV module and system parameters on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). The parameters selected include module manufacturing cost, efficiency, degradation rate, and service lifetime. NREL's System Advisor Model (SAM) is used to calculate the lifecycle cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for residential, commercial, and utility scale PV systems within the contiguous United States, with a focus on utility scale. Different technological pathways are illustrated that may achieve the Department of Energy's SunShot goal of PV electricity that is at grid price parity with conventional electricity sources. In addition, the impacts on the 2015 baseline LCOE due to changes to each parameter are shown. These results may be used to identify research directions with the greatest potential to impact the cost of PV electricity. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Renewable energy sources like wind energy is indigenous and can help in reducing the dependency on fossil fuels. Wind is the indirect form of solar energy and is always being replenished by the sun. Wind is caused by differential heating of the earth's surface by the sun. It has been estimated that roughly 10 million MW of energy are continuously available in the earth's wind. Wind energy provides a variable and environmental friendly option and national energy security at a time when decreasing global reserves of fossil fuels threatens the long-term sustainability of global economy. This paper reviews the wind resources assessment models, site selection models and aerodynamic models including wake effect. The different existing performance and reliability evaluation models, various problems related to wind turbine components (blade, gearbox, generator and transformer) and grid for wind energy system have been discussed.

   abstract = {Tandem solar cells are the next step in the photovoltaic (PV) evolution due to their higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) potential than currently dominating, but inherently limited, single-junction solar cells. With the emergence of metal halide perovskite absorber materials, the fabrication of highly efficient tandem solar cells, at a reasonable cost, can significantly impact the future PV landscape. The perovskite-based tandem solar cells have already shown that they can convert light more efficiently than their standalone sub-cells. However, to reach PCEs over 30%, several challenges have to be overcome and the understanding of this fascinating technology has to be broadened. In this review, the main scientific and engineering challenges in the field are presented, alongside a discussion of the current status of three main perovskite tandem technologies: perovskite/silicon, perovskite/CIGS, and perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cells. A summary of the advanced structural, electrical, optical, radiative, and electronic characterization methods as well as simulations being utilized for perovskite-based tandem solar cells is presented. The main findings are summarized and the strength of the techniques to overcome the challenges and gain deeper knowledge for further performance improvement is assessed. Finally, the PCE potential in different experimental and theoretical limits is compared with an aim to shed light on the path towards overcoming the 30% efficiency threshold for all of the three herein reviewed tandem technologies.},

   abstract = {As an emerging technology, the photovoltaic/concentrated solar power (PV-CSP) hybrid technology is considered as one of the research focuses currently in solar energy field, due to various advantages compared with the PV-alone and CSP-alone technologies. Compared with the PV-alone system, the PV-CSP hybrid system can produce electricity with better power quality. While compared with the CSP-alone system, the cost of power production can be reduced. The overall generating efficiency will also be greatly improved if the PV component and the CSP component of the hybrid system are “compactly” hybridized by PV-topping or spectral beam splitting (SBS) technologies. The development of PV-CSP hybrid systems accelerated in recent years with the increase of maturity of PV and CSP technologies. This paper presents an exhaustive review on the state-of-the-art of the PV-CSP hybrid technologies, including the non-compact hybrid system, the PV-topping hybrid system, the SBS hybrid system, and the hybrid system combining SBS and PV-topping technologies. Recent progresses of the key technologies of the PV-CSP hybrid systems, such as high temperature solar cells, spectral beam filters, and high flux heat exchangers, are generally discussed. After that, the research status and the hybrid system performance are summarized from the literature to provide a global point of view on the PV-CSP hybrid technology. The advantages and limitations of the hybrid technology are also concluded according to the literature reviewed.},

   abstract = {Polymeric organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells are promising candidates for low-cost, high-performance energy sources due to their low material and processing costs, flexibility, and ease of manufacturing by solution processes. However, low power-conversion efficiency (PCE) has impeded the development of OPV cells. The low PCE in OPV solar cells has been attributed to low carrier mobility, which is related to the transport length of the charge carriers within active layers. Graphene can be an ideal material for assisting the charge transport in the active layer of OPV cells due to its excellent charger carrier mobility, thermal and chemical stability, and compatibility with the solution process. In this work, we demonstrated for the first time an improvement of the PCE (up to 40%) in OPV bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) cells by incorporating charge-selective graphene flakes into the BHJ active layer. The charge selectivity of graphene flakes was achieved by nitrogen doping (N-doped graphene). The N-doped graphene, when mixed in the active layer (N-doped graphene/polymer:fullerene composites), provided transport pathways exclusively to specific charge carriers through the modulation of band-gap structures. We discuss further the enhancement of the PCE in OPV cells with respect to charge-carrier mobility. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.},

   abstract = {In this article, we report the development of inkjet printing technique for the fabrication of bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). We have demonstrated highly efficient OPV with a mixture of poly(3-hexylthiophene)s (P3HT) and 1-[3-(methoxycarbonyl)propyl]-1- phenyl[6.6]C61 (PCBM) as an inkjet-printed photoactive layer. Especially, 3.8% of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and 0.68 V of open circuit voltage (Voc) can be obtained by using the chlorobenzene as a solvent. This value is the highest performance in P3HT:PCBM based OPV system by now. We reveal that substantial improvements can be realized by nano-structured heterojunction after inkjet printing and this technique is one of the promising fabrication methods for organic photovoltaic cells. Also, we have designed and fabricated five-series connected large area (18cm2) inkjet-printed OPVs using the patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) with Au bus-electrode to minimize the efficiency drop due to the surface resistance of ITO. Consequently, 1.25% of power conversion efficiency can be obtained with a short circuit current of 1.24 mA/cm 2, a fill factor of 0.32, and an open circuit voltage of 3.2 V. © 2010 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.},

   abstract = {In organic semiconductors, optical excitation does not necessarily produce free carriers. Very often, electron and hole are bound together to form an exciton. Releasing free carriers from the exciton is essential for the functioning of photovoltaics and optoelectronic devices, but it is a bottleneck process because of the high exciton binding energy. Inefficient exciton dissociation can limit the efficiency of organic photovoltaics. Here, nanoscale features that can allow the free carrier generation to occur spontaneously despite being an energy uphill process are determined. Specifically, by comparing the dissociation dynamics of the charge transfer (CT) exciton at two donor–acceptor interfaces, it is found that the relative orientation of the electron and hole wavefunction within a CT exciton plays an important role in determining whether the CT exciton will decompose into the higher energy free electron–hole pair or relax to the lower energy tightly-bound CT exciton. The concept of the entropic driving force is combined with the structural anisotropy of typical organic crystals to devise a framework that can describe how the orientation of the delocalized electronic wavefunction can be manipulated to favor the energy-uphill spontaneous dissociation of CT excitons over the energy-downhill CT exciton cooling.},

The polymer (9,9â-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole; F8BT) is used as the electron donor and the N,Nâ-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic diimide (PDI) derivative is used as the electron acceptor. The thickness-dependent study of the main device parameters, namely of the external quantum efficiency (EQE), the short-circuit current (ISC), the open-circuit voltage (VOC), the fill factor (FF), and the dark current (ID) is presented. In as-spun F8BT:PDI devices the short-circuit EQE reaches the maximum of 17% and the VOC value is as high as 0.8 V. Device ID is in the nA mm-2 regime and it correlates with the topography of the F8BT:PDI layer. For a range of annealing temperatures ID is monitored as the morphology of the photoactive layer changes. The changes in the morphology of the photoactive layer are monitored via atomic force microscopy. The thermally induced coalescence of the PDI domains assists the dark conductivity of the device. ID values as low as 80 pA mm-2 are achieved with a corresponding EQE of 9%, when an electron-blocking layer (EB) is used in bilayer EB/F8BT:PDI devices. Electron injection from the hole-collecting electrode to the F8BT:PDI medium is hindered by the use of the EB layer. The temperature dependence of the ID value of the as-spun F8BT:PDI device is studied in the range of 296-216 K. In combination with the thickness and the composition dependence of ID, the determined activation energy Ea suggests a two-step mechanism of ID generation; a temperature-independent step of electric-field- assisted carrier injection from the device contacts to the active-layer medium and a thermally activated step of carrier transport across the device electrodes, via the PDI domains of the photoactive layer. Moreover, device ID is found to be sensitive to environmental factors. Minimizing the dark. The correlation between EQE and dark current in bulk heterojunction F8BT:PDI photodiodes is studied for a range of photoactive-layer thicknesses and reverse-bias voltages. For a given value of reverse bias operation, the improvement of the EQE reduces and the dark current increases as the photoactive layer becomes thinner. Dark current originates from the injection of electrons in the electron-accepting molecules (PDI) and from the subsequent carrier transport through the PDI network.

   abstract = {Organic solar cells have attracted huge attention because of their potential in the low-cost manufacturing of plastic solar modules featuring flexible, lightweight, ultrathin, rollable and bendable shapes. The power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells is now passing ~10%, which is a critical sign toward commercialization because organic solar cells surpass any other types of solar cells in terms of development speed. The encouraging efficiency enhancement could be realized by introducing a 'bulk heterojunction' concept that overcomes the weakness of organic semiconductors by minimizing their charge transport paths through making effective p-n junctions inside bulk organic films. However, there are several hurdles for commercialization, including stability and lifetime issues, owing to the bulk heterojunction concept. This review summarizes the important aspects of organic solar cells, particularly focusing on conjugated polymers as an active layer component. © 2014 Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers, Seoul, Korea.},

   abstract = {To devise a reliable strategy for achieving specific HOMO and LUMO energy level modulation via alternating donor-acceptor monomer units, we investigate a series of conjugated polymers (CPs) in which the electron withdrawing power of the acceptor group is varied, while maintaining the same donor group and the same conjugated chain conformation. Through experiment and DFT calculations, good correlation is identified between the withdrawing strength of the acceptor group, the HOMO and LUMO levels, and the degree of orbital localization, which allows reliable design principles for CPs. Increasing the acceptor strength results in an enhanced charge transfer upon combination with a donor monomer and a more pronounced decrease of the LUMO level. Moreover, while HOMO states remain delocalized along the polymer chain, LUMO states are strongly localized at specific bonds within the acceptor group. The degree of LUMO localization increases with increasing polymer length, which results in a further drop of the LUMO level and converges to its final value when the number of repeat units reaches the characteristic conjugation length. Based on these insights we designed PBT8PT, which exhibits 6.78% power conversion efficiency after device optimization via the additive assisted annealing, demonstrating the effectiveness of our predictive design approach.

To further enhance the conversion efficiency of perovskite-based photovoltaics, a hybridized system with near-infrared photovoltaics is a useful approach. Here we report a panchromatic sensitizer, coded DX3, that exhibits a broad response into the near-infrared, up to ∼1100 nm, and a photocurrent density exceeding 30 mA cm-2 in simulated air mass 1.5 standard solar radiation.

In this feature article we discuss these criteria considering thermodynamic limits, their correlation to photocurrent and photovoltage, and effects on the fill factor. Each criterion is quantified by a figure of merit (FOM) that directly relates to device performance. To ensure a wide applicability, we focus on FOMs that are easily accessible from common experiments. We demonstrate the relevance of these FOMs by looking at the historic and recent achievements of organic solar cells. We hope that the presented FOMs are or will become a valuable tool to evaluate, monitor, and guide further development of new organic absorber materials for solar cells.},

Conversion efficiencies that are coming closer and closer to the thermodynamic limits require a physical description of the corresponding solar cells that is compatible with those limits. This progress report summarizes recent work on the interdependence of basic material properties of semiconductor materials with their efficiency potential as photovoltaic absorbers. The connection of the classical Shockley–Queisser approach, with the band gap energy as the only parameter, to a more general radiative limit and to situations where nonradiative recombination dominates is discussed. The authors delineate a consistent loss analysis that enables a quantitative comparison between different solar cell technologies. In a next step, bulk material properties that influence the photovoltaic performance of a semiconductor like absorption coefficient, densities of states of the free carriers, or phonon energies are considered. It is shown that variations of these properties have a big influence on the optimized design of a solar cell but not necessarily on the achievable efficiency.},

   abstract = {Upscaling of the manufacture of polymer solar cells is detailed with emphasis on cost analysis and practical approach. The device modules were prepared using both slot-die coating and screen printing the active layers in the form of stripes that were serially connected. The stripe width was varied and the resultant performance analysed. Wider stripes give access to higher geometric fill factors and lower aperture loss while they also present larger sheet resistive losses. An optimum was found through preparation of serially connected stripes having widths of 9, 13 and 18 mm with nominal geometric fill factors (excluding bus bars) of 50, 67 and 75% respectively. In addition modules with lengths of 6, 10, 20, 22.5 and 25 cm were explored. The devices were prepared by full roll-to-roll solution processing in a web width of 305 mm and roll lengths of up to 200 m. The devices were encapsulated with a barrier material in a full roll-to-roll process using standard adhesives giving the devices excellent stability during storage and operation. The total area of processed polymer solar cell was around 60 m2 per run. The solar cells were characterised using a roll-to-roll system comprising a solar simulator and an IV-curve tracer. After characterisation the solar cell modules were cut into sheets using a sheeting machine and contacted using button contacts applied by crimping. Based on this a detailed cost analysis was made showing that it is possible to prepare complete and contacted polymer solar cell modules on this scale at an area cost of 89 € m-2 and an electricity cost of 8.1 € Wp-1. The cost analysis was separated into the manufacturing cost, materials cost and also the capital investment required for setting up a complete production plant on this scale. Even though the cost in € Wp-1 is comparable to the cost for electricity using existing technologies the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is expected to be significantly higher than the existing technologies due to the inferior operational lifetime. The presented devices are thus competitive for consumer electronics but ill-suited for on-grid electricity production in their current form. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

   abstract = {A complete polymer solar cell module prepared in the ambient atmosphere using all-solution processing with no vacuum steps and full roll-to-roll (R2R) processing is presented. The modules comprise five layers that were prepared on a 175-μm flexible polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) substrate with an 80-nm layer of transparent conducting indium-tin oxide (ITO). The ITO layer was first patterned by screen printing an etch resist followed by etching. The second layer was applied by either knife-over-edge (KOE) coating or slot-die coating a solution of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-nps) followed by curing. The second layer comprised a mixture of the thermocleavable poly-(3-(2-methylhexan-2-yl)-oxy-carbonyldithiophene) (P3MHOCT) and ZnO-nps and was applied by a modified slot-die coating procedure, enabling slow coating speeds with low viscosity and low surface tension ink solutions. The third layer was patterned into stripes and juxtaposed with the ITO layer. The fourth layer comprised screen-printed or slot-die-coated PEDOT:PSS and the fifth and the final layer comprised a screen-printed or slot-die-coated silver electrode. The final module dimensions were 28 cm×32 cm and presented four individual solar cell modules: a single-stripe cell, a two-stripe serially connected module, a three-stripe serially connected module and finally an eight-stripe serially connected module. The length of the individual stripes was 25 cm and the width was 0.9 cm. With overlaps of the individual layers this gave a width of the active layer of 0.6 cm and an active area for each stripe of 15 cm2. The performance was increased ten fold compared to mass-produced modules employing screen printing for all five layers of the device. The processing speeds employed for the R2R processed layers were in the range of 40-50 m h-1. Finally a comparison is made with the state of the art represented by P3HT-PCBM as the active layer and full R2R solution processing using slot-die coating. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Polymer solar cells are reviewed in the context of the processing techniques leading to complete devices. A distinction is made between the film-forming techniques that are used currently such as spincoating, doctor blading and casting and the, from a processing point of view, more desirable film-forming techniques such as slot-die coating, gravure coating, knife-over-edge coating, off-set coating, spray coating and printing techniques such as ink jet printing, pad printing and screen printing. The former are used almost exclusively and are not suited for high-volume production whereas the latter are highly suited, but little explored in the context of polymer solar cells. A further distinction is made between printing and coating when a film is formed. The entire process leading to polymer solar cells is broken down into the individual steps and the available techniques and materials for each step are described with focus on the particular advantages and disadvantages associated with each case. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Organic photovoltaics (OPV) are a new generation of solar cells with the potential to offer very short energy pay back times, mechanical flexibility and significantly lower production costs compared to traditional crystalline photovoltaic systems. A weakness of OPV is their comparative instability during operation and this is a critical area of research towards the successful development and commercialization of these 3rd generation solar cells. Covering both small molecule and polymer solar cells, Stability and Degradation of Organic and Polymer Solar Cells summarizes the state of the art understanding of stability and provides a detailed analysis of the mechanisms by which degradation occurs. Following an introductory chapter which compares different photovoltaic technologies, the book focuses on OPV degradation, discussing the origin and characterization of the instability and describing measures for extending the duration of operation. Topics covered include:  Chemical and physical probes for studying degradation  Imaging techniques  Photochemical stability of OPV materials  Degradation mechanisms  Testing methods  Barrier technology and applications   Stability and Degradation of Organic and Polymer Solar Cells is an essential reference source for researchers in academia and industry, engineers and manufacturers working on OPV design, development and implementation.},

The current-voltage (J-V) characteristics of the device have been studied in the dark as well as under illumination at different temperatures in the range 300-125 K. The variation in temperature strongly influences the device parameters and hence its performance. It has been found that (i) the lowering of the temperature results in a reduction in the rectification ratio, (ii) reverse bias current at low temperatures is governed by the tunnelling of the charge carriers and (iii) short circuit current (J sc) decreases while the open circuit voltage (Voc) increases with the decrease in temperature. The change in Voc with temperature has been attributed to the variation in the built-in voltage (V bi) arising due to band bending with a decrease in temperature. In summary the overall efficiency of the device first increases and then decreases with the reduction in temperature. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

We review scientific literature on bimolecular recombination (BR) in bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic devices to bring forward existing ideas on the origin and nature of BR and highlight both experimental and theoretical work done to quantify its extent. For these systems, Langevin theory fails to explain BR, and recombination dynamics turns out to be dependent on mobility, temperature, electric field, charge carrier concentration, and trapped charges. Relationships among the photocurrent, open-circuit voltage, fill factor, and morphology are discussed. Finally, we highlight the recent emergence of a molecular-level picture of recombination, taking into account the spin and delocalization of charges. Together with the macroscopic picture of recombination, these new insights allow for a comprehensive understanding of BR and provide design principles for future materials and devices.</p>},

Open-circuit voltages close to the expected sum of sub cell voltages were achieved, while the overall efficiency of the tandem cells was found to be limited by the low yielding back cell, which was processed from water based ink.

   abstract = {Charge transport in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is often characterized by steady-state mobilities. However, the suitability of steady-state mobilities to describe charge transport has recently been called into question, and it has been argued that dispersion plays a significant role. In this paper, the importance of the dispersion of charge carrier motion on the performance of organic photovoltaic devices is investigated. An experiment to measure the charge extraction time under realistic operating conditions is set up. This experiment is applied to different blends and shows that extraction time is directly related to the geometrical average of the steady-state mobilities. This demonstrates that under realistic operating conditions the steady-state mobilities govern the charge extraction of OPV and gives a valuable insight in device performance.},

The metal oxide-based HEL, MoO3, exhibited stable operating properties with a PCE drop rate of −0.13%/°C, as compared to polymeric HEL, PEDOT:PSS (−0.20%/°C).

The chemical structures of the NBG-NFAs contain a D′-D-D′ electron-rich internal core based on a cyclopentadithiophene (or dithienosilole) (D) and alkoxythienyl (D′) core, end-capped with the highly electron-deficient unit 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (A), ultimately providing a A-D′-D-D′-A molecular configuration that enhances the intramolecular charge transfer characteristics of the excited states. One can thereby reduce the optical bandgap (Egopt) to as low as ≈1.10 eV, one of the smallest values for NFAs reported to date. In bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs, NBG-NFA blends with the polymer donor PTB7-Th yield power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 9.0%, which is particularly high when compared against a range of NBG BHJ blends. Most significantly, it is found that, despite the small energy loss (Egopt − eVOC) of 0.52 eV, the PTB7-Th/NBG-NFA bulk heterojunction blends can yield short-circuit current densities of up to 22.8 mA cm−2, suggesting that the design and application of NBG-NFA materials have substantial potential to further improve the PCE of OSCs.},

   abstract = {We have performed slit coatings using a slot-die head with μ-tips in various shapes (rectangular-shaped, partially tapered, and linearly tapered μ-tips) to achieve high-density fine organic stripes for potential applications in solution-processable organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays. The fluid dynamics of an aqueous poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) in the presence of those μ-tips has been analyzed based on the electronic–hydraulic analogy. It is demonstrated that both line breakup occurring at low coating speeds with the rectangular-shaped narrow μ-tip and line broadening appearing with the rectangular-shaped wide μ-tip are avoidable using the linearly tapered μ-tip. It is attributed that the hydraulic resistance inside the slot-die head is decreased and the meniscus is well controlled by the linearly tapered structure. It also has a big advantage in the fabrication of multiple PEDOT:PSS stripes that the spacing between stripes can be kept constant. To fabricate high-density fine PEDOT:PSS stripes, we have devised a slot-die head with two meniscus guides embedded, each of which has 175 linearly tapered μ-tips. Using such a slot-die head, we have successfully fabricated 350 PEDOT:PSS stripes and 300 OLED stripes (59 stripes per inch) with the luminance of 350 cd/m2 at 5 V.},

   abstract = {The aim of this work is to investigate the feasibility of coating and patterning of fine organic thin-film stripes using double nozzles. For fine stripe coating of an aqueous poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), we have changed the outer surface of the needle from hydrophilic to hydrophobic in such a way that lateral capillary force is suppressed and thus the PEDOT:PSS stripe becomes narrow. Using a table coater with the hydrophobic needle (inner diameter = 51 μm), we have achieved the 54-μm-wide PEDOT:PSS stripe at a maximum coating speed of 30 mm/s. For micro patterning of PEDOT:PSS thin-film stripes, we have employed double needles; one for discharging the main solvent of the underlying thin film and the other for sucking the dissolved thin film. It is found that the pattern width decreases as the patterning speed increases and the pattern factor (the ratio of film thickness to slope length) is of the order of 10−3 due to the isotropic patterning characteristics. Such a patterning scheme is also shown to remove non-aqueous poly (N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) films coated in the presence of a bank structure. With the coating and patterning process, we have successfully fabricated multiple OLED stripes, an OLED device with the patterned light-emitting stripe, and OLED pixels, demonstrating its potential applicability to solution-processable OLEDs.},

We thus designed nearly isostructural nonfullerene electron acceptors, except for the choice of solubilizing units, which absorb from 600 to 1100 nm. Specific molecules include CTIC-4F, CO1-4F, and COTIC-4F, whose optical bandgaps are 1.3, 1.2, and 1.1 eV, respectively. Modulation of intramolecular charge transfer characteristics was achieved by replacing alkoxy groups with alkyl groups on thiophene spacers that connect an electron-rich cyclopentadithiophene core to peripheral electron-poor fragments. OSCs incorporating CTIC-4F and CO1-4F with PTB7-Th achieve power conversion efficiencies of over 10% with short-circuit current densities as high as a25 mA·cm-2. The same blends achieve OPD responsivities of 0.52 A·W-1 at a920 nm.

   abstract = {Phone (703) 978-5805, Fax (703) 978-6303 ABSTRACT Many proposals have been made to increase solar array efficiency by using two or mom cells with appropriately spaced bandgaps to span a greater portion of the incident spectrum. One such technique is to split the solar spectrum and focus each portion on a different cell bandgap. Each bandgap is selected to best match the input spectral portion and thus obtain maximum efficiency. This paper reports on the reexamination of the spectrally split, individually matched cell approach using modern-day optics and lightweight structures. The RAINBOW multi-bandgap system represents a unique combination of solar cells, concentrators and beam splitters. The use of separate cells offers the widest possible scope of material choices. Many different component combinations are possible. The relatively low temperature operation, due to reduced thermal input per cell, adds to the performance increase. Finally, RAINBOW is a flexible system which can readily expand as new high efficiency components are developed. Based to a large extent on data for real cells and optical components, RAINBOW is expected to convert over 40% of incident solar energy to electricity at the system level. This conclusion is based on preliminary analyses of cell and optics performances. I NTRO DU CTl ON Solar photovoltaic arrays are the most widely used form of energy conversion for powering all types of spacecraft. They are reliable, well understood, and adequate for most space applications. The principal drawback of solar arrays is their relatively high cost, with their relatively high mass being second. Both of these factors could be overcome if the overall array power conversion efficiency were to be significantly increased. For terrestrial applications, mass is less important, while efficiency and especially cost are more important. State of the art solar arrays utilize only a limited portion of the incident solar spectrum, wasting the remainder. This is because a solar cell can only generate current if the wavelength of the incident light is greater than the bandgap energy of the semiconductor. The incident photons must have enough energy to promote electrons to the conduction band of the semiconductor. Furthermore, for wavelengths with energies much greater than the bandgap, the excess energy cannot be utilized. Thus even high quality cells with high quantum efficiencies, such as GaAs, exhibit relatively modest conversion efficiencies, since they cannot respond with high quantum efficiencies to more than a relatively small portion of the incident spectrum. AM0 (space) and AM1.5 (terrestrial) solar spectra are: available in the literature (e. g. Green, 1992). Many proposarls have been made to increase solar array efficiency by using two or more cells with appropriately spaced bandgaps to span a greater portion of the incident spectrum. The leading candidate technique to implement this is a vertically-stacked configuration in which two dissimilar bandgap cells a r e stacked atop one another. This creates, in effect, a vertically stacked array. This can be used with or without optical concentration, and requires no spectral filter, since the wavelengths not usable by the top cell pass through and can be absorbed by the bottom cell. The methods have been discussed in detail in the literature and a wide variety of experimental stacked cells have been developed, primarily two-junction but also three-junction cells (Yamaguchi and Wakamatsu, 19916; Chiang et. al., 1996; and Yeh et. al., 1996). Presently, several different industry, university and national laboratory groups are pursuing the stacked-cell approach for two-and three-junction stacks. This technique is nearing in-space demonstration in the SCARLET solar array being developed by EIMDO, NASA-LeRC and JPL for the New Millennium program. It has the disadvantage that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to implement more than three different bandgap cells in the stacked cell scheme. The alternative technique is to split the solar spectrum and focus each portion on a different cell bandgap. Each bandgap is selected to best match the input spectral portion and thus obtain maximum emciency. This technique was first conceived by Alvi et. a1 (1976), who proposed the use of selective mirrors to divide the incident solar spectrum into energy 401 Authorized licensed use limited to: Universiteit Hasselt.

   abstract = {Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) sandwich a blend layer of conjugated polymer donor and fullerene derivative acceptor between a transparent ITO positive electrode and a low work function metal negative electrode. In comparison with traditional inorganic semiconductor solar cells, PSCs offer a simpler device structure, easier fabrication, lower cost, and lighter weight, and these structures can be fabricated into flexible devices. But currently the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs is not sufficient for future commercialization. The polymer donors and fullerene derivative acceptors are the key photovoltaic materials that will need to be optimized for high-performance PSCs. In this Account, I discuss the basic requirements and scientific issues in the molecular design of high efficiency photovoltaic molecules. I also summarize recent progress in electronic energy level engineering and absorption spectral broadening of the donor and acceptor photovoltaic materials by my research group and others. For high-efficiency conjugated polymer donors, key requirements are a narrower energy bandgap (E(g)) and broad absorption, relatively lower-lying HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) level, and higher hole mobility. There are three strategies to meet these requirements: D-A copolymerization for narrower E(g) and lower-lying HOMO, substitution with electron-withdrawing groups for lower-lying HOMO, and two-dimensional conjugation for broad absorption and higher hole mobility. Moreover, better main chain planarity and less side chain steric hindrance could strengthen π-π stacking and increase hole mobility. Furthermore, the molecular weight of the polymers also influences their photovoltaic performance. To produce high efficiency photovoltaic polymers, researchers should attempt to increase molecular weight while maintaining solubility. High-efficiency D-A copolymers have been obtained by using benzodithiophene (BDT), dithienosilole (DTS), or indacenodithiophene (IDT) donor unit and benzothiadiazole (BT), thienopyrrole-dione (TPD), or thiazolothiazole (TTz) acceptor units. The BDT unit with two thienyl conjugated side chains is a highly promising unit in constructing high-efficiency copolymer donor materials. The electron-withdrawing groups of ester, ketone, fluorine, or sulfonyl can effectively tune the HOMO energy levels downward. To improve the performance of fullerene derivative acceptors, researchers will need to strengthen absorption in the visible spectrum, upshift the LUMO (the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy level, and increase the electron mobility. [6,6]-Phenyl-C(71)-butyric acid methyl ester (PC(70)BM) is superior to [6,6]-phenyl-C(61)-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) because C(70) absorbs visible light more efficiently. Indene-C(60) bisadduct (ICBA) and Indene-C(70) bisadduct (IC(70)BA) show 0.17 and 0.19 eV higher LUMO energy levels, respectively, than PCBM, due to the electron-rich character of indene and the effect of bisadduct. ICBA and IC(70)BA are excellent acceptors for the P3HT-based PSCs.},

In this manuscript, we report polymer photovoltaic devices based on RR-P3HT:methanofullerene [6,6]-phenyl- C61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) 1: 1 weight-ratio blend. We studied the effects of annealing temperature and time on the device performance for devices annealed before and after cathode deposition. Thermal annealing shows significant improvement in the performance for both types of annealing conditions, with postproduction annealing being slightly better. For devices with a 43-nm-thick active layer, maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.2% and fill factor up to 67% is achieved under Air Mass 1.5, 100-mW cm2 illumination. We performed atomic force microscopy and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy on the P3HT:PCBM films to explain the effect of thermal annealing. By keeping the optimized thermal annealing condition and by varying the active layer thickness, we fabricated devices with PCE up to 4.0%, which is the highest efficiency reported so far for this system. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {The chemical structure of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) affects their light-harvesting capabilities, energy levels and molecular orders, all of which play a crucial role in determining the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we have systematically investigated a series of ladder-type NFAs having different carbon-oxygen-bridged electron-donating cores, and revealed the effects of core structures and film casting conditions on molecular ordering and performance of OSCs. We found that NFAs containing the thieno [3,2-b]thiophene centered, 6 or 8 fused rings (i.e. COi6DFIC, COi8DFIC) exhibit narrower optical band gaps than NFAs containing the benzene centered, 5 or 7 fused rings (i.e. COi5DFIC, COi7DFIC). NFAs containing less fused rings in the carbon-oxygen-bridged core (i.e. COi5DFIC and COi6DFIC) exhibit edge-on molecular orientation in the blends with face-on oriented PTB7-Th donor, and result in low device efficiency. Although NFAs containing more fused rings (i.e. COi7DFIC and COi8DFIC) possess a pronounced flat-on lamellar crystalline structure in the pure state, the crystallization can be reduced when blending with PTB7-Th and under hot-substrate casting, while the lamella in COi8DFIC can be effectively suppressed to form face-on H- and J-type aggregates, leading to enhanced efficiency.},

Specifically, three key factors, including chemical-, photon-, and thermal-, induced degradations in NFAs are analyzed and summarized, with approaches to enhance the stability suggested. This is followed by the discussion of shelf and operational stability of NFA based OSCs, with highlights of operational stabilities in inert, ambient, indoor, and outdoor conditions.

The influences of incorporation of the isomeric rigid alicyclic structure onto the backbone of the polymers were systematically investigated in terms of optical, thermal, mechanical, dielectric and surface properties, respectively. Due to the moderate chemical imidization condition, CPI-x series retain higher glass transition temperature (Tg) in the range of 329–429 °C than the Tg of TPI-x (from 321.9 °C to 370.7 °C). Therefore, the CPI-1 film based 5-DAPI was chosen as the flexible substrate. MoO3 was chosen as the interface layer to improve the compatibility between PI substrate and the metal electrode.

   abstract = {The morphology with the interpenetrating network and optimized vertical phase separation plays a key role in determining the charge transport and collection in polymer:nonfullerene small molecular acceptors (SMAs) solar cells. However, the crystallization of polymer and SMAs usually occurs simultaneously during film-forming, thus interfering with the crystallization process of each other, leading to amorphous film with undesirable lateral and vertical phase separation. The poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):O-IDTBR blend is selected as a model system, and controlling film-forming kinetics to solve these problems is proposed. Herein, a cosolvent 1,2,4-triclorobenzene (TCB) with selective solubility and a high boiling point is added to the solution, leading to prior crystallization of P3HT and extended film-forming duration. As a result, the crystallinity of both components is enhanced significantly. Meanwhile, the prior crystallization of P3HT induces solid–liquid phase separation, hence rationalizing the formation of the nano-interpenetrating network. Moreover, the surface energy drives O-IDTBR to enrich near the cathode and P3HT to migrate to the anode. Consequently, a highly crystalline nano-interpenetrating network with proper vertical phase separation is obtained. The optimal morphology improves charge transport and suppresses bimolecular recombination, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 4.45% to 7.18%, which is the highest performance in P3HT-based binary nonfullerene solar cells.},

   abstract = {Semi-transparent solar cells can be used for spectral beam splitting (SBS) in which short-wavelength photons are converted to electricity and long-wavelength photons are transmitted to thermal absorbers. However, these thermal absorbers can only produce low-grade thermal energy because the semi-transparent solar cell cannot concentrate long-wavelength photons. In this study, based on the idea of regulating the radiation field to match the energy conversion on-demand, the strategy to use a single piece of photovoltaic (PV) to regulate the photon capture of the full solar spectrum for realizing the co-generation of electricity and high-grade thermal energy is proposed. A semi-transparent solar cell with a serrated groove structure at the bottom is designed and fabricated. The cell can convert 400–800 nm wavelength photons to electricity, and focus 800–2500 nm wavelength photons to a small spot to produce high-temperature thermal energy. A novel α-Si thin-film semi-transparent solar cell-based SBS hybrid photovoltaic/concentrated solar thermal system is established. The feasibility of the system is validated through indoor and outdoor experiments. The utilization efficiency of the full-spectrum solar energy can reach 77%. The high average concentrated irradiance of up to 4.31 KW/m2 transmitted through the semi-transparent solar cells is sufficient for high-temperature thermal utilization.},

Among all AM techniques, fused filament fabrication (FFF) is the most widely used technique for polymers. However, the consistency and properties control of the FFF product remains a challenging issue. This study aims to investigate physical changes during the 3D printing of polylactic acid (PLA). The correlations between the porosity, crystallinity and mechanical properties of the printed parts were studied. Moreover, the effects of the build-platform temperature were investigated. The experimental results confirmed the anisotropy of printed objects due to the occurrence of orientation phenomena during the filament deposition and the formation both of ordered and disordered crystalline forms (α and δ, respectively). A heat treatment post-3D printing was proposed as an effective method to improve mechanical properties by optimizing the crystallinity (transforming the δ form into the α one) and overcoming the anisotropy of the 3D printed object.},

   abstract = {An optimum thickness of organic active layer of 100 nm or possibly less results in poor optical absorption in organic photovoltaic cells (OPV). The optical absorption can be improved by using a thick organic active layer, but the charge carrier collection efficiency will decrease due to low charge carrier mobility for most of the polymeric organic semiconductor. This phenomenon imposes a trade-off between optical absorption and charge carriers transport inside OPV. Recently, metallic nanostructures such as gold (Au) and silver (Ag) with various sizes and morphologies have been identified as an alternative route to boost the performance of OPV at this specific limited thickness (ie. ≤100 nm). Multiple plasmonic effects such as optical and electrical effects are induced upon introducing metallic nanoparticle(s), NP(s) into OPV. This review highlights recent progress in plasmonic-enhanced poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl): phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT: PCBM)-based OPV with NP(s) located either inside organic active layer or carrier transport layer (CTL) or at various interfaces within the OPV cell architecture. With understanding of the physical plasmonic effects for Au and Ag in OPV, such plasmonic NP(s) act as a new class of strategy for performance optimization.},

A narrow stripe could be produced either through a slot die with a shim to control the slot width or through a rectangular nozzle. A flow visualization technique was employed to observe the mechanism on how a narrow stripe breaks at high coating speeds. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical simulations on coating flows were also carried out to examine the fluid motion. The coating solution was found to expand laterally after emanating from the slot die channel at low coating speeds. The stripe width contracts gradually with increasing coating speed until coating failures appear. The coating defect observed switches from ribbing to a periodic stable and break-up motion. The effects of various fluid properties, geometric and operating parameters on the variation of coating width and maximum coating speeds were examined. A universal correlation involving two dimensionless groups, Reynolds and Bond number, was established for the prediction of coating width. © 2013 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

This review summarizes the published literature concerning the material properties of CdTe1−xSex and its application in current thin film CdTe photovoltaics. One of the important properties of CdTe1−xSex is its band gap bowing, which facilitates a lowering of the CdTe band gap towards the optimum band gap for highest theoretical efficiency. In practice, a CdTe1−xSex gradient is introduced to the front of CdTe, which induces a band gap gradient and allows for the fabrication of solar cells with enhanced short-circuit current while maintaining a high open-circuit voltage. In some device structures, the addition of CdTe1−xSex also allows for a reduction in CdS thickness or its complete elimination, reducing parasitic absorption of low wavelength photons.</p>},

   abstract = {Fast and efficient charge separation is essential to achieve high power conversion efficiency in organic solar cells (OSCs). In state-of-the-art OSCs, this is usually achieved by a significant driving force, defined as the offset between the bandgap (E gap) of the donor/acceptor materials and the energy of the charge transfer (CT) state (E CT), which is typically greater than 0.3 eV. The large driving force causes a relatively large voltage loss that hinders performance. Here, we report non-fullerene OSCs that exhibit ultrafast and efficient charge separation despite a negligible driving force, as E CT is nearly identical to E gap. Moreover, the small driving force is found to have minimal detrimental effects on charge transfer dynamics of the OSCs. We demonstrate a non-fullerene OSC with 9.5% efficiency and nearly 90% internal quantum efficiency despite a low voltage loss of 0.61 V. This creates a path towards highly efficient OSCs with a low voltage loss.},

The photodiodes display a peak monochromatic sensitivity of 6×10-13 w (cps)-12 at 8500 A and have half-sensitivity points at 9100 and 5600 A. The dynamic impedance of these detectors is in the order of one meg and their time constant, which is determined by the dynamic impedance and junction capacity, is on the order of 1 msec. Noise measurements in the 200–1500-cps region show no evidence of any 1/f component. Preliminary experiments indicate that these photodiodes are equally sensitive when operated in the back-biased or photoconductive mode. The detectors operate at room temperature and do not require encapsulation. Several detectors have been successfully immersed behind sapphire optics. The optical transparency of GaAs in the 1- to 5-μ region enables the detector to be used in front of a suitable I. R. detector, e.g., InAs, in “two-color” detection systems. The sensitivity of this detector is found to compare favorably with a commercial photomultiplier.},

However, PLA is highly fragile and presents low impact strength; hence improvements on this way are industrially and technologically important. Aiming to develop proper methodology for higher PLA performance, this work investigated the effects of thermal annealing on the mechanical properties (impact, tensile, Shore D hardness), heat deflection temperature (HDT), Vicat softening temperature (VST) and crystallinity (X-ray diffraction) of PLA. Injected specimens were annealed in greenhouses at 70, 80, 90 and 100 °C. Annealing at 70 °C was not effective, without verified significant changes. On the other hand, annealing at 80, 90 and 100 °C provided crystalline peaks in DRX, indicating development of structural organization. Expressive results were achieved, at 90 °C, for impact strength, HDT, VST, Shore D hardness and tensile strength, related to non-annealed PLA. Provided results in this work have scientific and technological importance, since the mechanical and thermomechanical properties of PLA were improved using a simple methodology which may render higher performance products mainly for the 3D printing industry of PLA.</p>},

We also compare data from 1995 and 2000 presented at World Geothermal Congresses in Italy and Japan, respectively (WGC95 and WGC2000). As in previous reports, an effort is made to quantify ground-source (geothermal) heat pump data. The present report is based on country update papers prepared for WGC2010 and other sources of data available to the authors. Final update papers were received from 70 countries of which 66 reported some direct utilization of geothermal energy. Twelve additional countries were added to the list based on other sources of information. Direct utilization of geothermal energy in 78 countries is a significant increase from the 72 reported in 2005, the 58 reported in 2000, and the 28 reported in 1995. An estimate of the installed thermal power for direct utilization at the end of 2009 is used in this paper and equals 48,493MWt, almost a 72% increase over the 2005 data, growing at a compound rate of 11.4% annually with a capacity factor of 0.28. The thermal energy used is 423,830TJ/year (117,740GWh/yr), about a 55% increase over 2005, growing at a compound rate of 9.2% annually. The distribution of thermal energy used by category is approximately 47.2% for ground-source heat pumps, 25.8% for bathing and swimming (including balneology), 14.9% for space heating (of which 85% is for district heating), 5.5% for greenhouses and open ground heating, 2.8% for industrial process heating, 2.7% for aquaculture pond and raceway heating, 0.4% for agricultural drying, 0.5% for snow melting and cooling, and 0.2% for other uses. Energy savings amounted to 250 million barrels (38 million tonnes) of equivalent oil annually, preventing 33 million tonnes of carbon and 107 million tonnes of CO2 being release to the atmosphere, this includes savings for geothermal heat pumps in the cooling mode (compared to using fuel oil to generate electricity). © 2011.},

   abstract = {In research on photovoltaic (PV) device degradation, current-voltage (I-V) datasets carry a large amount of information in addition to the maximum power point. Performance parameters such as short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, shunt resistance, series resistance, and fill factor are essential for diagnosing the performance and degradation of solar cells and modules. To enable the scaling of I-V studies to millions of I-V curves, we have developed a data-driven method to extract I-V curve parameters and distributed this method as an open-source package in R. In contrast with the traditional practice of fitting the diode equation to I-V curves individually, which requires solving a transcendental equation, this data-driven method can be applied to large volumes of I-V data in a short time. Our data-driven feature extraction technique is tested on I-V curves generated with the single-diode model and applied to I-V curves with different data point densities collected from three different sources. This method has a high repeatability for extracting I-V features, without requiring knowledge of the device or expected parameters to be input by the researcher. We also demonstrate how this method can be applied to large datasets and accommodates nonstandard I-V curves including those showing artifacts of connection problems or shading where bypass diode activation produces multiple 'steps.' These features together make the data-driven I-V feature extraction method ideal for evaluating time-series I-V data and analyzing power degradation mechanisms in PV modules through cross comparisons of the extracted parameters.},

We fabricate devices in a sandwich geometry, where the mask (nanoindented with a periodic array of holes of sizes d and spacing s) is added between the transparent electrode and the active layer formed by a blend of the semiconducting polymer P3HT and substituted fullerene. Its function is to promote trapping of the incident light into the device's cavity (the region corresponding to the active layer). For d, we set a value that allows light diffraction through the holes in the relevant absorption range of the polymer. To optimize the mask structure, we consider a very simple model to determine the s leading to trapped fields that are relatively intense and homogeneous within the device. From measurements of the action spectra, we show that, indeed, such architecture can considerably improve the resulting photocurrent efficiencies-one order of magnitude in the best situation studied. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

One of the biggest challenges so far is to reduce their band gap toward the visible region while simultaneously retaining ferroelectricity. To address these two issues, herein an elemental composition engineering of BiFeO 3 is performed by substituting Fe by Co cations, as a means to tune the characteristics of the transition metal-oxygen bond. We demonstrate by solution processing the formation of epitaxial, pure phase, and stable BiFe 1-x Co x O 3 thin films for x ≤ 0.3 and film thickness up to 100 nm. Importantly, the band gap can be tuned from 2.7 to 2.3 eV upon cobalt substitution while simultaneously enhancing ferroelectricity. As a proof of concept, nonoptimized vertical devices have been fabricated and, reassuringly, the electrical photoresponse in the visible region of the Co-substituted phase is improved with respect to the unsubstituted oxide.},

Herein, the importance of these techniques is explained with examples from various aspects of OSCs. Different pre- and post-processing conditions such as solvent effect, solvent additive, solvent, and thermal annealing are studied in the framework of these techniques. Moreover, the impact of donor:acceptor ratio and molecular weight of semiconductor on microstructure is also explored. Finally, the effect of chemical structure of organic semiconductors (both polymers and small molecules) on the film morphology is discussed. These techniques provide valuable information about crystallinity, phase separation, and domain size of nanostructured film morphology, which helps to optimize the film morphology and enhances the performance of OSCs. The role of these techniques will become more important as the mystery of film morphology still has to be solved.},

Photons entering perpendicular to that plate may be trapped in an intermittent chaotic trajectory, leading to an optically ergodic system. We fabricated such a photonic fiber plate and showed that for a solar cell incorporated on one of the plate surfaces, light absorption is greatly enhanced. Confirming this, we found the unexpected result that a more chaotic photon trajectory reduces the production of photon scattering entropy.},

Unlike fullerene derivatives, NFAs tend to crystallize from solutions, resulting in bulk heterojunctions that include a crystalline acceptor phase. This must be considered in any morphology-function models. Here, it is confirmed that high-performing solution-processed indacenodithienothiophene-based NFAs, i.e., ITIC and its derivatives ITIC-M, ITIC-2F, and ITIC-Th, exhibit at least two crystalline forms. In addition to highly ordered polymorphs that form at high temperatures, NFAs arrange into a low-temperature metastable phase that is readily promoted via solution processing and leads to the highest device efficiencies. Intriguingly, the low-temperature forms seem to feature a continuous network that favors charge transport despite of a poorly order along the π–π stacking direction. As the optical absorption of the structurally more disordered low-temperature phase can surpass that of the more ordered polymorphs while displaying comparable—or even higher—charge transport properties, it is argued that such a packing structure is an important feature for reaching highest device efficiencies, thus, providing guidelines for future materials design and crystal engineering activities.},

Artificial materials with nano-scale modulation of the refractive index, such as photonic crystals, are able to exercise such control and have opened exciting new possibilities for light manipulation. An interesting alternative to such periodic structures is the class of materials known as quasi-crystals, which offer unique advantages such as richer Fourier spectra. Here we introduce a novel approach for designing such richer Fourier spectra, by using a periodic structure that allows us to control its Fourier components almost at will. Our approach is based on binary gratings, which makes the structures easy to replicate and to tailor towards specific applications. As an example, we show how these structures can be employed to achieve highly efficient broad-band light trapping in thin films that approach the theoretical (Lambertian) limit, a problem of crucial importance for photovoltaics. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The optical response of the metallic architectures can be engineered to exhibit photonic properties that span from plasmon resonances to more complex phenomena such as negative refractive index, optical chirality, artificial magnetism, and more. However, the latter optical properties are only observed in intricate architectures, which are highly demanding in terms of nanofabrication and hence less scalable and far away from device implementation. Here, a series of metasurfaces covering centimeter areas and operating in the visible spectrum are presented, which are produced from the combination of nanoimprinting lithography and oblique angle metal evaporation. The potential of this scalable approach is illustrated by easily fabricating metasurfaces engineered to exhibit artificial optical magnetism, tunable linear polarization dependent response, chirality with g-factor of 0.2, and photoluminescence enhancement of 20 times over a 9 mm2 area.},

   abstract = {A key factor in solar cell efficiency is the dependence of the photocurrent on applied bias. With respect to organic solar cells, it is often suggested that this factor is governed by the field dependence of charge-transfer state separation. Here, we demonstrate that this is not the case in benchmark polythiophene/methanofullerene solar cells. By examining the temperature and light intensity dependence of the current-voltage characteristics, we determine that (1) the majority of free charge generation is not dependent on the field or temperature and (2) the competition between extraction and recombination of free charges principally determines the dependence of photocurrent on bias. These results are confirmed by direct observation of the temperature dependence of charge separation and recombination using transient absorption spectroscopy and highlight that in order to achieve optimal fill factors in organic solar cells, minimizing free carrier recombination is an important consideration. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

Temperatures ranged from 250 ~ to 600~ and the electric fields ranged from +106 to -106 V/cm in ambients of vacuum (10 -6 torr), ni- trogen (N~), and forming gas (N2H2). In dry N2 (<3 ppm H~O), the activation energy for silver diffusion is found to be 1.24 eV in the temperature range of 275°-365°C. The diffusion coefficient for silver at 300°C in silicon dioxide is 4.5*10^-13 cm²/s. Copper diffusion has an activation energy of 1.82 eV in the temperature range of 350°-450°C in a forming gas environment (<3 ppm H2O) and a diffusion coefficient in SiO2 at 450°C of 1.2*10^-11 cm2/s.

With a bandgap of ~1.6 eV, lead halide perovskite solar cells have achieved power conversion efficiencies in excess of 25%. Despite this, poor material stability along with lead contamination remains a significant barrier to commercialization. Recently, low-dimensional perovskites, where at least one of the structural dimensions is measured on the nanoscale, have demonstrated significantly higher stabilities, and although their power conversion efficiencies are slightly lower, these materials also open up the possibility of quantum-confinement effects such as carrier multiplication. Furthermore, both bulk perovskites and low-dimensional perovskites have been demonstrated to form hybrids with silicon nanocrystals, where numerous device architectures can be exploited to improve efficiency. In this review, we provide an overview of perovskite solar cells, and report the current progress in nanoscale perovskites, such as low-dimensional perovskites, perovskite quantum dots, and perovskite-nanocrystal hybrid solar cells.</p>},

This review provides a brief history of solution-processed bulk heterojunction OPVs and the advent of solvent additives, putting them into context with other methods available for morphology control. It presents the current understanding of how solvent additives impact various mechanisms of phase separation, enabled by recent advances in in situ morphology characterization. Indeed, understanding solvent additives' effects on film formation has allowed them to be applied and combined effectively and synergistically to boost OPV performance. Their success as a morphology control strategy has also prompted the use of solvent additives in related organic semiconductor technologies. Finally, the role of solvent additives in the development of next-generation OPV active layers is discussed. Despite concerns over their environmental toxicity and role in device instability, solvent additives remain relevant morphological directing agents as research interests evolve toward nonfullerene acceptors, ternary blends, and environmentally sustainable solvents.},

For example, new chemistries and synthetical methodologies have been developed; especially, the breakthrough Y-series acceptors, originally invented by our group, specifically Y1, Y3, and Y6, have contributed immensely to boosting single-junction solar cell efficiency to around 19%; novel device architectures such as tandem and transparent organic photovoltaics have been realized. The concept of NIR donors/acceptors thus becomes a turning point in the OPV field. Here, the development of NIR-absorbing materials for OPVs is reviewed. According to the low-energy absorption window, here, NIR photovoltaic materials (p-type (polymers) and n-type (fullerene and nonfullerene)) are classified into four categories: 700–800 nm, 800–900 nm, 900–1000 nm, and greater than 1000 nm. Each subsection covers the design, synthesis, and utilization of various types of donor (D) and acceptor (A) units. The structure–property relationship between various kinds of D, A units and absorption window are constructed to satisfy requirements for different applications. Subsequently, a variety of applications realized by NIR materials, including transparent OPVs, tandem OPVs, photodetectors, are presented. Finally, challenges and future development of novel NIR materials for the next-generation organic photovoltaics and beyond are discussed.},

A mathematical approach is presented which enables a fast way of spectral mismatch correction for MJ cells, thereby significantly reducing the time required for calibration. Moreover, a systematic investigation of the I-V parameters of a MJ solar cell with variation of the incident spectrum is possible, herein called 'spectrometric characterization'. This analysis method visualizes the effects of current limitation and shifting of the operating voltage, and yields precise information about the current-matching of the subcells. MJ cells can hereby be compared without the need to match the current of the structures to a reference spectrum in advance. Further applications of the spectrometric characterization are suggested, such as for the determination of the radiation response of the subcells of MJ space solar cells or for the prediction of the annual power output of terrestrial MJ concentrator cells.

The occurrence of space–charge limited current enables a direct determination of the electron mobility. At room temperature, an electron mobility of μe = 2 × 10–7 m2 V–1 s–1 has been obtained. This electron mobility is more than three orders of magnitude larger than the hole mobility of donor-type conjugated polymer poly(2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene) (OC1C10-PPV). As a result, the dark current in PCBM/OC1C10-PPV based devices is completely dominated by electrons. The observed field and temperature-dependence of the electron mobility of PCBM can be described with a Gaussian disorder model.

This work has explored the optical modeling of different organic photoactive materials to identify the potential materials for efficient tandem structure. The performance of double, triple, and quadruple junction tandem OSCs with suitable bandgaps has been analyzed with photoactive materials. The absorption efficiency enhances considerably using the thickness optimization of each subcell in tandem structures. Current matching in all subcells, an essential factor for efficient device operation, is taken into account while optimizing tandem structures. The quadruple design can achieve better photovoltaic performance than double or triple junction devices. The efficiency predicted from our proposed quadruple structure is 15.45%, with a short-circuit current density, JSC of ∼9 mA/cm2 and an open-circuit voltage, VOC of 2.64 V.

The involved solar cells are made of AlGaAs and Si. The same solar cells are integrated in a system with beam-splitting features. On the basis of the response of the two systems, the two approaches are compared.},

The devices behave linearly with optical power, for illumination over and below the bandgap. The study of the responsivity of AlGaN MSM photodiodes reveals a gain mechanism which is only active at bias over 2 V, and for excitation over the bandgap. This mechanism is responsible for the superlinear increase of the responsivity with bias, and also for the enhancement of the UV/visible contrast observed in these devices. A NEP* lower than 2 pW/Hz1/2 has been obtained in GaN MSM photodetectors, at 28 V bias.},

From a consideration of the energy diagrams, the electron transfer from poly)3-alkylthiophene) to C60 is proposed to be favorable in energy at account of Jahn-Teller splitting of LUMO in C60-1 state or/and the Coulomb attraction of positively charged polaron P+ to C60-1. The suppression of photoluminescence(PL) in poly(3-alkylthiophene) upon doping by Buckminsterfullerene has also been observed confirming the doping effect.

   abstract = {Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are a recent technology that has gained much attention as a potential low cost power source. Despite this promise, there is a lack of published studies that address the likely cost of commercial-scale OPV modules. In this work, an engineering study estimate has been performed to determine the projected cost of mass-manufactured OPV modules. The materials, production capital and operating costs have been calculated and sensitivity analyses performed to determine the parameters of greatest economic influence. Significantly, the model includes a calculation of the costs required to establish bulk manufacturing of the current high cost speciality materials components, encompassing synthesis and associated chemical plant design. The economic modelling reveals that the calculated mass-manufactured OPV module costs are considerably lower than current literature estimates, with OPV modules costed at $7.85 per square metre with an uncertainty of±30%. Total module cost was found to be most sensitive to the plastic substrate prices, while the production rate did not have a significant impact on module cost for rates above~50 m2/min. The results highlight the future cost potential of OPV technology and can be used to assist with scale-up planning. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {This report presents recent progress in computational modeling efforts on blend morphology of P3HT:PCBM-based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) thin-film organic solar cells (OSCs). Improving power conversion efficiency (PCE), developing cost-effective fabrication methods and designing suitable electron donor and acceptor materials have been the most critical issues related to organic solar cell research in the past decade. Mixtures of poly-(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as electron-donor and electron-acceptor materials, respectively, have been widely investigated over the past decade. Despite the advances in experimental techniques, like atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy and electron tomography, acquiring three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale morphological information from BHJ devices is challenging due to poor contrast in electron microscopy techniques of organic materials. Atomistic simulations are able to provide insights into the dynamics of blend morphology of OSCs and overcome the experimental challenges. In addition, coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation is able to simulate structures approaching experimental length scales and processing conditions. Here we discuss about the insights that have been gained from classical atomistic simulations with an emphasis on CGMD modeling techniques developed in recent years. Effect of solution processing conditions and thermal annealing process on the morphology and dynamics of BHJ devices are reviewed as well. Finally, the future scope of molecular modeling efforts to tackle current and anticipated challenges in organic photovoltaic technologies are suggested, with a goal to identify the opportunities that remain open to be addressed by atomistic computations of OSCs.},

A comparison between standard and inverted device configurations demonstrates that the inverted configuration is more suitable for achieving thicker active layers when a high hole mobility donor is used. We attribute this to the longer hole collection path in the inverted structure, which can benefit from using a high hole mobility material.

A tandem device with a Ag(In 0.2Ga0.8)Se2 (AIGS) top cell and a Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) bottom cell showed an open-circuit-voltage (Voc) of 1.46 V. It was, however, found that the short-circuit current (Jsc) of a two-terminal tandem device was limited by the low Jsc of the filtered bottom cell because of a current mismatch between the top and bottom cells. In order to improve the Jsc of the filtered bottom cell, we have tried two process options, replacing ITO back contacts with high-mobility (Mo-doped In2O3) IMO and the use of low-Ga content CIGS bottom cells. The Jsc of the filtered bottom cells increased significantly using these techniques. As a result, an 8 % total-area (0.5cm2) efficiency 2-terminal mechanical stacked tandem device was achieved using a CIGS (15% Ga) bottom cell with an AIGS top cell fabricated with an IMO back contact. © 2006 IEEE.},

In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of energy and charge cascade structures at the interfaces by using well-defined planar heterojunctions (PHJs) as a model system. The results showed that (1) the charge cascade structure enhanced V OC because it shuts down the recombination pathway through charge transfer (CT) state with a low energy, (2) the charge cascade layer having a wider energy gap than the bulk material decreased J SC because the diffusion of the excitons from the bulk to D/A interface was blocked; the energy of the cascade layers must be appropriately arranged for both the charges and the excitons, and (3) molecular intermixing in the cascade layer opened the recombination path through the low-energy CT state and decreased V OC. Based on these findings, we propose improved structures for D/A interfaces in BHJs.},

   abstract = {A key requirement for realizing efficient organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is the dissociation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs (singlet-excitons) in the donor polymer, and charge-transfer-excitons at the donor-acceptor interface. However, in modern OPVs, these excitons are typically not sufficiently harnessed due to their high binding energy. Here, we show that doping the OPV active-layers with a ferroelectric polymer leads to localized enhancements of electric field, which in turn leads to more efficient dissociation of singlet-excitons and charge-transfer-excitons. Bulk-heterojunction OPVs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester are fabricated. Upon incorporating a ferroelectric polymer as additive in the active-layer, power conversion efficiencies increase by nearly 50%, and internal quantum efficiencies approach 100% - indicating complete exciton dissociation at certain photon energies. Similar enhancements in bilayer-heterojunctions, and direct influence of ferroelectric poling on device behavior show that improved dissociation is due to ferroelectric dipoles rather than any morphological change. Enhanced singlet-exciton dissociation is also revealed by photoluminescence lifetime measurements, and predicted by simulations using a numerical device model. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

We review critically the contributions of the various factors, including electric fields, long-range order, and excess energy (beyond the minimum needed for photoexcitation), to the probability that photogenerated charge carriers will be separated. Understanding the processes occurring at the O/O interface and their relative importance for effective charge separation is crucial to design efficient solar cells and photodetectors. We stress that electron and hole delocalization after photoinduced charge transfer at the interface is important for efficient free carrier generation. Fewer defects at the interface and long-range order in the materials also improve overall current efficiency in solar cells.

The metal-oxide heterojunction generates a photovoltaic effect due to the high open-circuit voltage (0.4 V), which spontaneously drives the NiO/TiO2 photodetector for self-powered operations. Therefore, the transparent NiO/TiO2 photodetector exhibits a self-operation mode with a fast response time (0.1 ms) while providing a high responsivity (0.43 A W−1) and detectivity (8.6 × 109 Jones) without any external bias. Extreme cycle testing (over 20,000 times) was performed to confirm the high stability of the transparent NiO/TiO2 photodetector.

   abstract = {The exploitation of some fossil fuels such as oil, intended as gasoline or diesel fuel, natural gas and coal, currently satisfy the majority of the growing world energy demand, but they are destined to run out relatively quickly. Beyond this point, their combustion products are the main cause of some global problems such as the greenhouse effect, the hole in the ozone layer, acid rains and generalized environment pollution, so their impact is extremely harmful. Therefore, it is clear that a solution to the energy problem can be obtained only through the use of renewable sources and by means of the exploitation of new low-polluting fuels. In this scenario an important role might be played by hydrogen, which is able to define a new energy system that is more sustainable and cleaner than current systems. For the comparison of the different fuels investigated in this paper, a methodology, which defines appropriate technical and environmental quality indexes, has been developed. These indexes are connected to the pollution produced by combustion reactions and to their intrinsic characteristics of flammability and expansiveness linked to the use of the considered fuels. An appropriate combination of these indexes, in the specific sector of utilization, allows to evaluate a global environmental index for the investigated fuels, highlighting that hydrogen reaches the highest score. In the final part of the paper, a new hydrogen energy economy that would lead to solving the serious environmental problems that damages all the ecosystems of the planet earth, is presented.},

   abstract = {A novel cell architecture for organic solar cells is presented which is based on a functional microprism substrate. In contrast to the most widely used planar cell architecture with a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode, the microstructure results in a folded solar cell. Of benefit are the light trapping effect and the substitution of the ITO-electrode by a highly conductive polymer layer with a supporting metal grid. Optical simulations were performed and reveal a gain in absorption in the photoactive layer due to the inclined incidence of radiation and due to the second reflection. Optimal dimensions of the microstructure were calculated by taking the sheet resistivity of the polymer anode and the shading effect of the metal grid into account. The metal grid with a low effective sheet resistance below 1 Ω/□ was realised by evaporation techniques using the microstructure as a self aligning mask. Investigations on the thin film formation are presented. First microprism solar cells with solar efficiencies comparable to planar ITO-reference solar cells were realised. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The light harvesting efficiency of dye-sensitized photoelectrodes was enhanced by coupling a TiO2 photonic crystal layer to a conventional film of TiO2 nanoparticles. In addition to acting as a dielectric mirror, the inverse opal photonic crystal caused a significant change in dye absorbance which depended on the position of the stop band. Absorbance was suppressed at wavelengths shorter than the stop band maximum and was enhanced at longer wavelengths. This effect arises from the slow group velocity of light in the vicinity of the stop band, and the consequent localization of light intensity in the voids (to the blue) or in the dye-sensitized TiO2 (to the red) portions of the photonic crystal. By coupling a photonic crystal to a film of TiO2 nanoparticles, the short circuit photocurrent efficiency across the visible spectrum (400-750 nm) could be increased by about 26%, relative to an ordinary dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 photoelectrode.},

   abstract = {Conjugated polymer chains have many degrees of conformational freedom and interact weakly with each other, resulting in complex microstructures in the solid state. Understanding charge transport in such systems, which have amorphous and ordered phases exhibiting varying degrees of order, has proved difficult owing to the contribution of electronic processes at various length scales. The growing technological appeal of these semiconductors makes such fundamental knowledge extremely important for materials and process design. We propose a unified model of how charge carriers travel in conjugated polymer films. We show that in high-molecular-weight semiconducting polymers the limiting charge transport step is trapping caused by lattice disorder, and that short-range intermolecular aggregation is sufficient for efficient long-range charge transport. This generalization explains the seemingly contradicting high performance of recently reported, poorly ordered polymers and suggests molecular design strategies to further improve the performance of future generations of organic electronic materials. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Each PV fiber element is designed to maximize the power conversion efficiency within a narrow band of the incident solar spectrum, while reflecting other spectral components through the use of optical microcavity effects and distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) coatings. Combining PV fibers with complementary absorption and reflection characteristics into volume-filling arrays enables spectrally tuned modules having an effective dispersion element intrinsic to the architecture, resulting in high external quantum efficiency over the incident spectrum. While this new reflective tandem architecture is not limited to one particular material system, here we apply the concept to organic PV (OPV) cells that use a metal-organic-metal-dielectric layer structure, and calculate the expected performance of such arrays. Using realistic material properties for organic absorbers, transport layers, metallic electrodes, and DBR coatings, 17% power conversion efficiency can be reached.},

This work aims atdescribing the conditions that tandem cells and modules need to fulfill to successfully enter the market in 2030.We first estimate that industrial c-Si photovoltaic modules may reach a price level of about 15 c$/W in 2030 at a PCE of 22–24%, with an expected lifetime of 30 years and an annual degradation of 0.5%. For commercial relevance, we anticipate that tandem module efficiencies need to be increased to reach around 30%, while matching lifetime and degradation rate of c-Si modules. Provided these conditions, we find that these tandem modules could then have a cost bonus of around 5–10 c$/W compared to c-Si modules for reaching equal levelized cost of energyvalues.},

Thus, the light intensity is defined not by the measured photocurrent but by the delay time of appearance of the strong forward current with the amplitude independent of the light intensity. Our experimental results as well as finite element modeling show that the dynamic mode of photodiode operation can potentially provide an improvement of the device performance.},

   abstract = {This paper describes photovoltaic (PV) module architectures with parallel-connected submodule-integrated dc-dc converters (subMICs) that improve efficiency of energy capture in the presence of partial shading or other mismatch conditions. The subMICs are bidirectional isolated dc-dc converters capable of injecting or subtracting currents to balance the module substring voltages. When no mismatches are present, the subMICs are simply shut down, resulting in zero insertion losses. It is shown that the objective of minimum subMIC power processing can be solved as a linear programming problem.Asimple close-to-optimal distributed control approach is presented that allows autonomous subMIC control without the need for a central controller or any communication among the subMICs. Furthermore, the proposed control approach is well suited for an isolated-port architecture, which yields additional practical advantages including reduced subMIC power and voltage ratings. The architectures and the control approach are validated by simulations and experimental results using three bidirectional flyback subMICs attached to a standard 180-W, 72-cell PV module, yielding greater than 98% module-level power processing efficiency for a mismatch less than 25%. © 2013 IEEE.},

The concentrator is comprised of a primary one axis parabolic trough concentrator and a second stage compound parabolic concentrator mounted at the focus of the primary. The thermoelectric device is attached to the absorber plate at the focus of the secondary. A cooling tube is ®tted to the cold side of the thermoelectric device to extract the waste heat and maintain a high temperature gradient across the device to improve conversion eciency. The key requirements of the concentrator design are to be tolerant of tracking misalignment, maintain temperature gradients to suit thermoelectric generation and minimise heat losses. A design methodology is presented which allows interception of rays within an angular region 2d. This results in a wider receiver for the parabolic trough concentrator than would usually be used for a similar concentration ratio. The role of the second stage concentrator in limiting heat losses from the absorber plate is evaluated. Results indicate that in addition to improving the concentration eciency, the second stage compound parabolic concentrator of the proposed design also inhibits convective air movement and, consequently, improves the overall performance of the solar concentrator. #},

Currently, an increase in efficiency is achieved by converting from the 3-junction to the more efficient 4-, 5-, and even 6-junction III–V architectures: growth technologies and methods of post-growth treatment of structures have been developed, new materials with optimal bandgaps have been designed, and crystallographic parameters have been improved. In this review, we consider recent achievements and prospects for the main directions of research and improvement of architectures, technologies, and materials used in laboratories to develop solar cells with the best conversion efficiency: 35.8% for space, 38.8% for terrestrial, and 46.1% for concentrated sunlight. It is supposed that by 2020, the efficiency will approach 40% for direct space radiation and 50% for concentrated terrestrial solar radiation. This review considers the architecture and technologies of solar cells with record-breaking efficiency for terrestrial and space applications.

   abstract = {Saturation of photodetectors is measured in the time domain using optical pulses of different duration and in the frequency domain using amplitude-modulated optical carriers. In the time domain, saturation is characterized by a reduction in peak photocurrent and growth of a pulse tail indicating that significant carrier velocity reduction is occurring as the opposing space-charge field persists. In the frequency domain, saturation is characterized by a reduction in response to a sinusoidal signal. The time-domain saturation measurements are shown to result in substantially larger 1-dB compression currents than frequency-domain measurements for the same photodiode. Transient space-charge calculations and a spectral analysis based on Gaussian pulses are shown to help to explain the apparent differences and to correlate the measured results from the time and frequency domains. © 1999 IEEE.},

   abstract = {For the first time, the application of large-area 2D colloidal photonic crystals for light trapping in flexible OPV modules is demonstrated via the study of a broad range of light trapping structures deposited simply and cheaply using our novel roll-to-roll Langmuir–Blodgett technique. Commercially available flexible OPV modules with a size of 10 cm × 14 cm were used. Colloidal silica spheres with diameters ranging from 50 nm to 740 nm were used for the photonic crystal fabrication. The photonic structures made from SiO2 spheres with diameters of 50 nm and 120 nm demonstrate good antireflective properties in the visible and near-infrared spectral range, which have a pronounced positive effect on the photocurrent and the power conversion efficiency in OPV modules at all angles of the light incidence. The 2D photonic crystals made from SiO2 spheres with diameters of 600 nm and 740 nm show strong diffractive scattering of incident light in the forward direction, which results in significant light trapping effects in the OPV modules which again gives rise to an improvement in the cell characteristics. The observed light trapping effects vary only slightly with angle of incidence, suggesting that such photonic crystal layers could be of direct benefit in terms of the response of the OPV modules without the need to track the sun position as it moves across the sky.},

This is achieved by patterning a one-dimensional photonic crystal (1DPC) in this layer. Indeed, by coupling the incident light into slow Bloch modes of the 1DPC, we can control the photon lifetime and then, enhance the absorption integrated over the whole solar spectrum. Optimal parameters of the 1DPC maximize the integrated absorption in the wavelength range of interest, up to 45% in both S and P polarization states instead of 33% for the unpatterned, 100 nm thick amorphous silicon layer. Moreover, the absorption is tolerant with respect to fabrication errors, and remains relatively stable if the angle of incidence is changed.},

The bulk-heterojunction OPV devices were fabricated by using poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as a donor and an acceptor material, respectively. Significant changes of surface morphology and grain size were observed by varying annealing temperature, which is possibly due to different diffusion rate of PCBM molecules into the bulk-heterojunction polymer films. From these results, we conclude that differences in surface morphology and grain size are responsible for the significantly different PCE in the OPV devices. Consequently, the PCE is improved from 0.5 to 2.6% combined with the increase of short-circuit current and fill factor by annealing treatment at 150°C. © 2009 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.},

To obtain maximum performance in terms of mechanical strength, experimental studies were conducted considering the thermal process parameters such as nozzle and chamber temperatures. These optimal process settings and carefully controlled heating conditions, incorporated with post-processing of additional heat treatment, could provide a high degree of crystallinity and high tensile strength (i.e., more than 90% compared to original material properties). To demonstrate the feasibility of industrial applications, we fabricated and tested several product prototypes, such as a wafer jig, a lathe chuck part, and plastic injection molds, all of which confirmed the excellent performance of PEEK for chemical resistance, high strength, and heat resistance, respectively.},

   abstract = {Slot die coating has been established as an economical approach for deposition of parallel narrow stripes, a constituent pattern feature in many printed device applications. However, the minimum feature size that can be achieved using this approach is constrained by wetting and liquid bridge phenomena at the deposition region. We hypothesize that pattern resolution and process control can be improved by co-depositing a support fluid to stabilize the pattern. Electrically conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is slot die-coated in parallel stripes on flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrate, without wettability-enhancing dopants or substrate pretreatment. A miscible liquid phase, polyvinyl alcohol, is used as the support material. Feature size performance and conductivity of PEDOT:PSS stripe regions are evaluated across a range of process conditions. Narrow PEDOT:PSS stripes produced using our technique range from 400 to 850 μm and exhibit conductivity approaching 1.5 S cm-1. This electrical performance falls within the upper range expected prior to standard conductivity-enhancing post-treatments. Significantly, dewetting effects normally present with undoped PEDOT:PSS on the plastic substrate are fully mitigated with our deposition technique. These results indicate high ease of processing and good feature size performance, with few inherent drawbacks to the functional properties of the patterned films.},

Organic and perovskite semiconductors possess a set of properties that make them particularly suitable for narrowband photodetection. This has led to rising interest in their use towards such functionality, and has driven remarkable progress in recent years. Through a comparative analysis across an extensive body of literature, this review provides an up-to-date assessment of this rapidly growing research area. The transversal approach adopted here focuses on the identification of: (a) the unifying aspects underlying organic and perovskite narrowband photodetection in the visible and in the near infrared range; and (b) the trends relevant to photoconversion efficiency and spectral width in relation to material, device and processing strategies. A cross-sectional view of organic and perovskite narrowband photodetection is thus delineated, giving fresh insight into the status and prospects of this research area.</p>},

   abstract = {A method to quantify spectral effects on the electric parameters of multi-junction solar cells is presented. The method is based on measuring the short circuit current of at least two monitor cells. Ideally these monitor cells have the same spectral responses as the subcells in the investigated multi-junction solar cell. In contrast to the subcells, the current of the individual monitor cells can be measured separately. This allows conclusions to be drawn about the spectral impact on the current mismatch of the multi-junction solar cell. A spectrometric evaluation method is then applied. The method has been tested experimentally with three concentrator modules using III-V triple-junction solar cells. These modules were measured outdoors for several months under variable solar spectral conditions. In parallel, the IV curves of the modules and the current of two component cells were measured. A spectral parameter Z was derived from the monitor cell current signals, which was correlated to the short circuit current and the fill factor of the modules. A linear correlation was found between Z and the normalized short circuit current of the concentrator modules. Translation equations were derived from the linear correlation. These enable the calculation of a module's short circuit current under any spectral conditions. In particular, the short circuit currents of the modules were derived for direct normal irradiance of 850 W/m2 and spectral conditions corresponding to the AM1.5d low AOD spectrum. This is an important step towards comparing the performance of modules which show strong spectral sensitivity. Future rating methods can benefit from the presented simple method for quantifying spectral impacts on multi-junction solar cells. Furthermore, the method can be of interest for tuning the spectrum of pulsed solar simulators. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To date, there have not been systematic performance parameter comparisons between conventional and inverted devices that consider a range of different metal electrodes and presence of native metal oxides at the organic-metal interface. Here, we systematically compute optical and electronic performance parameters for both conventional and inverted BHJ-OPV devices for 15 different electrode types covering a range of workfunctions. We quantitatively demonstrate that (1) high-workfunction metal electrodes (Au, Pd, Ni) are ideal for high-efficiency inverted device performance; and (2) native metal oxide on metal electrodes (e.g., CuO/Cu, Ag2O/Ag, NiO/Ni), which dramatically reduce conventional device efficiencies, can result in highly efficient inverted BHJ-OPV devices (efficiency of up to 6.7% for the P3HT:PCBM system). This work is an important advance over prior studies as it predicts the electrode materials and configurations that can lead to both high efficiency and high stability BHJ-OPV devices. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This degradation is mainly due to humidity, temperature, system bias effects and solar irradiation. The solar cell itself may be suffering different degradation mechanisms like light, temperature and potential induced degradation (LID, TID and PID [1]). The focus of this paper is the initial degradation of solar cells within the first hours of operation, which is generally associated with LID. In this work, differences in degradation mechanism for multi and mono cells are investigated for cells and panels based on p-type crystalline silicon. The quality of silicon material is essential as shown in a material comparison. Low and high base resistivities are investigated and different silicon purities ranging from standard feedstock material of different qualities to material based on upgraded metallurgical (UMG) silicon are compared. Interestingly no clear difference between the LID of industrial multi- and mono-crystalline cells was found. However, UMG cells show a higher degradation rate partly due to a mechanism identified as temperature induced degradation (TID) that occurs in parallel to LID.},

This reaction is reversible, as dimers can be thermally decomposed at sufficiently elevated temperatures and both photodimerization and decomposition are temperature dependent. In operando conditions of OSCs evidently involve exposure to both light and heat, following periodic diurnal and seasonal profiles. In this work, the kinetics of dimer formation and decomposition are examined and quantified as a function of temperature, light intensity, blend composition, and time. The activation energy for photodimerization is estimated to be 0.021(3) eV, considerably smaller than that for decomposition (0.96 eV). The findings are benchmarked with a variety of conjugated polymer matrices to propose a descriptive dynamic model of PCBM:dimer population in OSCs, and a framework is proposed to rationalize its interplay with morphology evolution and charge quenching. The model and parameters enable the prediction of the dynamic and long-term PCBM:dimer populations, under variable temperature and light conditions, which impact the morphological stability of OSCs.},

   abstract = {Charge transport and nongeminate recombination are investigated in two solution-processed small molecule bulk heterojunction solar cells consisting of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based donor molecules, mono-DPP and bis-DPP, blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). While the bis-DPP system exhibits a high fill factor (62%) the mono-DPP system suffers from pronounced voltage dependent losses, which limit both the fill factor (46%) and short circuit current. A method to determine the average charge carrier density, recombination current, and effective carrier lifetime in operating solar cells as a function of applied bias is demonstrated. These results and light intensity measurements of the current-voltage characteristics indicate that the mono-DPP system is severely limited by nongeminate recombination losses. Further analysis reveals that the most significant factor leading to the difference in fill factor is the comparatively poor hole transport properties in the mono-DPP system (2 × 10-5 cm2 V-1 s-1 versus 34 × 10-5 cm2 V-1 s-1). These results suggest that future design of donor molecules for organic photovoltaics should aim to increase charge carrier mobility thereby enabling faster sweep out of charge carriers before they are lost to nongeminate recombination.

   abstract = {Solution deposited bulk heterojunction organic solar cells are viewed as one of the most promising alternative energy sources because of their ease of processing and their potential to be produced using large scale techniques such as roll-to-roll, newspaper style, coating. Since organic materials have a relatively low dielectric constant the dissociation of an excited electron-hole pair into free collectable charge carriers is inefficient in many cases. Often the excited electron-hole pairs recombine back to the ground state in a process known as geminate recombination before they ever fully dissociate into free charge carriers. Even after dissociation, free holes and electrons can encounter each other once more and subsequently recombine back to the ground state in a process known as nongeminate recombination. In both cases the incident photon energy is lost and fewer carriers are collected at the electrodes. Hence, charge carrier recombination is one of the key loss mechanisms in organic solar cells. In this review the latest on geminate and nongeminate recombination is discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Open-circuit voltage (VOC) is the maximum voltage a solar cell can provide to an external circuit, which is derived from the splitting of hole and electron quasi-Fermi levels. In crystalline Si solar cells, the effective density of states at the bottom (top) of the conduction (valence) band is constant, and the quasi-Fermi level can be directly calculated via the Fermi-Dirac distribution. However, in organic materials, similar to amorphous Si, disorder induces gap tail states. Relaxation of carriers into these tail states brings the electron quasi-Fermi level down and the hole quasi-Fermi level up, and hence reduces VOC. Furthermore, carrier recombination of various kinds can cause additional loss of VOC. This article reviews the research progress in understanding the origin of VOC in organic solar cells. In particular, the dependence of VOC on four important factors, namely temperature, light intensity, work function of the electrode and material microstructure are discussed based on the model of density of states. Techniques to enhance VOC are also briefly introduced and their mechanisms are analysed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.},

To achieve accurate results, the melt flow fields in combination with the heat transfer and change in tensile modulus are considered. The model includes the secondary transition, both in terms of latent heat and in terms of other thermodynamic and physical variables. The simulation is based on the assumption that there is no volume change during solidification of ABS. It is also assumed that the velocity of the melted ABS is constant and uniform throughout the modeling domain. The transition from the glassy to the molten state of ABS is modeled using the heat capacity model. A narrow secondary transition is observed during the glass-transition temperature.},

In this work, we present transparent solar cell substrates having quasi-periodic uniaxial nanowrinkle patterns with high optical haze values. The self-organized nanowrinkle template is created by controlled heat-shrinking of metal-deposited pre-stretched polystyrene sheets. A scalable UV-nanoimprinting method is used to transfer the nanopatterns to glass substrates on which single-junction hydrogenated amorphous silicon p-i-n solar cells are subsequently fabricated. The structural and optical analyses of the solar cell show that the nanowrinkle pattern is replicated throughout the solar cell structure leading to enhanced absorption of light. The efficient broadband light-trapping in the nanowrinkle solar cells results in very high 18.2 mA/cm2 short-circuit current density and 9.5% energy-conversion efficiency, which respectively are 35.8% and 39.7% higher than the values obtained in flat-substrate solar cells.

   abstract = {Organic semiconductor heterojunction (HJ) energy level offsets are modeled using a combination of Marcus theory for electron transfer, and generalized Shockley theory of the dark current density vs voltage (J-V) characteristics. This model is used to fit the J-V characteristics of several donor-acceptor combinations commonly used in thin film organic photovoltaic cells. In combination with measurements of the energetics of donor-acceptor junctions, the model predicts tradeoffs between the junction open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC). The VOC is found to increase with light intensity and inversely with temperature for 14 donor-acceptor HJ materials pairs. In particular, we find that VOC reaches a maximum at low temperature (∼175 K) for many of the heterojunctions studied. The maximum value of VOC is a function of the difference between the donor ionization potential and acceptor electron affinity, minus the binding energy of the dissociated, geminate electron-hole pair: a general relationship that has implications on the charge transfer mechanism at organic heterojunctions. The fundamental understanding provided by this model leads us to infer that the maximum power conversion efficiency of double heterostructure organic photovoltaic cells can be as high as 12%. When combined with mixed layers to increase photocurrent and stacked cells to increase VOC, efficiencies approaching 16% are within reach. © 2007 The American Physical Society.},

We then examine recent platforms and the fundamental aspects of selective harvesting of holes and electrons at opposite contacts. For blended heterojunction OPVs, contact/interlayer design is especially critical because charge harvesting competes with recombination at these same contacts. New interlayer materials can modify contacts to both control work function and introduce selectivity and chemical compatibility with nonpolar active layers and add thermodynamic and kinetic selectivity to charge harvesting. We briefly discuss the surface and interface science required for the development of new interlayer materials and take a look ahead at the challenges yet to be faced in their optimization. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {<p>Abstract. Because of its wide coverage over much of the globe, biomass burning has been widely studied in the context of direct radiative forcing. Such study is warranted as smoke particles scatter and at times absorb solar radiation efficiently. Further, as much of what is known about smoke transport and impacts is based on remote sensing measurements, the optical properties of smoke particles have far reaching effects into numerous aspects of biomass burning studies. Global estimates of direct forcing have been widely varying, ranging from near zero to −1 W m-2. A significant part of this difference can be traced to varying assumptions on the optical properties of smoke. This manuscript is the third part of four examining biomass-burning emissions. Here we review and discuss the literature concerning measurement and modeling of optical properties of biomass-burning particles. These include available data from published sensitivity studies, field campaigns, and inversions from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) of Sun photometer sites. As a whole, optical properties reported in the literature are varied, reflecting both the dynamic nature of fires, variations in smoke aging processes and differences in measurement technique. We find that forward modeling or ''internal closure'' studies ultimately are of little help in resolving outstanding measurement issues due to the high degree of degeneracy in solutions when using ''reasonable'' input parameters. This is particularly notable with respect to index of refraction and the treatment of black carbon. Consequently, previous claims of column closure may in fact be more ambiguous. Differences between in situ and retrieved ωo values have implications for estimates of mass scattering and mass absorption efficiencies. In this manuscript we review and discuss this community dataset. Strengths and lapses are pointed out, future research topics are prioritized, and best estimates and uncertainties of key smoke particle parameters are provided.</p>},

The structure of the material was examined as a function of time; it is found that the overall structure, as measured by the structure factor, changes appreciably during the deformation. The intensity of the first peak is decreased under stress and the polymer chains are deformed. The dynamics are studied using both the bond autocorrelation function and the incoherent dynamic structure factor. It is found that the dynamics are strongly correlated with the strain rate in the material. Additionally, each measure of the dynamics is uniformly enhanced by the same amount. Previous simulations have shown that the enhanced dynamics do not correlate with changes in the volume in any clear manner; here, evidence from simulations indicates that the enhanced dynamics correlate with the energy of the inherent structures of the material, suggesting that changes in the materials' position on the potential energy landscape lead to the observed enhanced dynamics. Finally, the results of simulations are discussed in terms of two theories of stress-induced dynamics. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

Concerning the first principle, the thermoelectric collector (TEC) delivers electricity indirectly by first producing heat and subsequently generating electricity by means of a thermoelectric generator. Concerning the second principle, the photovoltaic-hybrid collector (PVHC) uses photovoltaic cells, which are cooled by a liquid heat-transfer medium. The characteristics of both collector types are described. Simulation modules have been developed and implemented in TRNSYS 14.1 (1994), in order to simulate their behaviour in typical domestic hot-water systems. The discussion of the results shows that the electric output of the PV-hybrid collector is significantly higher than that of the thermoelectric collector.},

In flow equilibrium, a homogeneous semiconductor gives off this chemical energy by radiative recombination to the surroundings. If provision is made, as by a p-n junction, to divert the excited electrons and holes, before they recombine, from their point of generation, their chemical energy may be converted into electrical energy. The ratio of this chemical energy current, which constitutes an upper limit for the obtainable electrical energy current, to the absorbed heat current is computed as a function of the value of the bandgap of the semiconductor. Under the assumption that the absorptivity of the electron-hole system of the semiconductor is unity for photon energies larger than the bandgap and zero for smaller photon energies, the conversion efficiency for unfocussed sunlight has a maximum of 30 percent for a bandgap of 1.3 eV. © 1980 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Long-term stability of polymer solar cells is determined by many factors, one of which is thermal stability. Although many thermal stability studies occur far beyond the operating temperature of a solar cell which is almost always less than 65 °C, thermal degradation is studied at temperatures that the solar cell would encounter in real-world operating conditions. At these temperatures, movement of the polymer and fullerenes, along with adhesion of the polymer to the back contact, creates a barrier for electron extraction. The polymer barrier can be removed and the performance can be restored by peeling off the electrode and depositing a new one. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements reveal a larger amount of polymer adhered to electrodes peeled from aged devices than electrodes peeled from fresh devices. The degradation caused by hole-transporting polymer adhering to the electrode can be suppressed by using an inverted device where instead of electrons, holes are extracted at the back metal electrode. The problem can be ultimately eliminated by choosing a polymer with a high glass transition temperature. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

The conversion temperature was controlled in order to investigate the influence of the crystallinity of the organic semiconducting layer in the PHJ solar cell on the cell performance. The crystallinity of BPc increased with annealing temperature, but the surface roughness did not change. The cell with BPc converted at 250 °C had a power conversion efficiency that was 2.5 times better (1.49%) than that of the cell converted at 150 °C, and 1.5 times better than the cell with a vacuum-deposited BPc layer. The mobility of BPc, measured from the space charge limited current characteristics, supports a clear correlation between crystallinity and cell performance. Thus, the importance of increasing the crystallinity and mobility in organic solar cells was experimentally demonstrated. This journal is © the Partner Organisations 2014.},

Coupled partial differential equations are simplified by applying the lubrication approximation theory and assuming that the coating layer thickness is much less than the blade length. The obtained system is normalized using suitable scales. A numerical solution of the governing boundary value problem is developed for various third-grade parameters. In addition, a perturbation solution is also obtained for small third-grade parameters. Interesting quantities such as pressure, pressure gradient, velocity, and load are computed and shown graphically and in tables. How the involved parameters influence the results is examined. The load on the blade is the most important physical quantity in the present work as it controls the coating thickness and quality.

Light absorption in organic semiconductors generates a bound electron-hole pair (exciton), which needs to travel to the interface between electron donor and acceptor materials to dissociate into charge carriers. Because the exciton diffusion length in organic semiconductors is typically much shorter than the light absorption depth (∼100 nm), planar donor-acceptor heterojunctions are inefficient, and most effort has been dedicated to optimization of bulk heterojunctions with nanoscale phase separation. In this Perspective, we review recent findings and new approaches to increase the exciton diffusion length and discuss how these improvements can benefit environmentally friendly production of solar modules using organic nanoparticles or graded heterojunctions obtained by sequential deposition of electron donor and acceptor. Organic photovoltaic solar cells (OPVs) have made remarkable progress, with lightweight and flexible solar modules now becoming commercially available and the first large-area installations completed. So far, these modules are produced by thermal evaporation in vacuum, which is an expensive technology. There is great potential for low-cost manufacture of OPVs by roll-to-roll coating of solution-processed materials, and efficient small cells have been reported using the bulk heterojunction architecture in which electron donors and acceptors are mixed on the nanoscale to enable charge generation in materials with short exciton diffusion length. However, the fabrication of such structures is delicate and difficult to scale up. Recent work shows that exciton diffusion length can be improved to enable exciton harvesting over longer distances, opening a pathway to much simpler manufacturing. In particular, enhanced exciton diffusion can improve light harvesting in solar cells that can be manufactured using water-based solutions of electron donor and acceptor nanoparticles or by sequential deposition of donor and acceptor, offering low-cost and environmentally friendly production.

Extensive bibliographic research was carried out on articles published from 1998 to 2020 to identify various aspects OPV, such as the principle of operation, advantages, disadvantages, and which layers can be printed by each technique. The results show that the most used method for the processing of OPVs is spin-coating. In the studies found, rotation was used to coat the active layer, the electron transport layer, and the hole transport layer. The techniques of pad printing, casting, and meniscus are considered useful in the processing of the active layer. Regarding the deposition of the active layer, hole transport layer, electron transport layer, and anode, the rotogravure, crack matrix, spraying, and brushing techniques were satisfactory. Flexography has been used to form the active layer, electron transport layer, and anode. Screen printing, inkjet printing, and knife/blade coating were used in the processing of the active layer, hole transport layer, electron transport layer, anode, and cathode. All the double slot die coating, curtain coating, and slide coating allows simultaneous processing of multiple layers. Techniques compatible with roll-to-roll processing are more likely to be at the center of OPVs in the future, thus making solar photovoltaic technology more competitive.},

   abstract = {The absorption factor of a PV cell is defined as the fraction of incident solar irradiance that is absorbed by the cell. This absorption factor is one of the major parameters determining the cell temperature under operational conditions. Experimentally the absorption factor can be derived from reflection and transmission measurements. The spectral reflection and transmission factors were measured for a set of crystalline silicon (c-Si) samples with a gradually increasing complexity. The experimental results agree very well with the results from a 2D numerical model that was developed. It was found that the AM1.5 absorption factor of a typical encapsulated c-Si photovoltaic cell is as high as 90.5%. Insight was gained in the cell parameters that influence this absorption factor. The presence of texture at the front of the c-Si wafer of sufficient steepness is essential to achieve such a high absorption factor. Sub-bandgap solar irradiance (λ > 1.1 μ m) is mainly absorbed in the very thin emitter by means of free-carrier absorption. By minimizing reflective losses over the entire solar spectrum, the AM1.5 absorption of c-Si cells can theoretically be increased to 93.0%. The effect on the annual yield of PV and PV/thermal systems is quantified. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The importance of high power conversion efficiencies for the commercial exploitation is outlined and different efficiency models for bulk heterojunction solar cells are discussed. Assuming state of the art materials and device architectures several models predict power conversion efficiencies in the range of 10-15%. A more general approach assuming device operation close to the Shockley-Queisser-limit leads to even higher efficiencies.

The improved semiconductor technology now allows detectors operating near the physical limits of the detector materials to be designed. The mean energy required for producing an electron-hole pair, W, is a material property of the semiconductor. Here, the determination of W from the spectral responsivity of photodiodes is demonstrated. Using spectrally dispersed synchrotron radiation, different types of semiconductor photodiodes have been examined in the UV-, VUV-, and soft X-ray spectral range. Their spectral responsivity was determined with relative uncertainties between 0.4% and 1% using a cryogenic electrical-substitution radiometer as primary detector standard. Results are presented for silicon n-on-p junction photodiodes and for GaAsP/Au Schottky diodes at room temperature. The investigations for silicon covered the complete spectral range from 3 to 1500 eV, yielding a constant value W = (3.66±0.03) eV for photon energies above 50 eV, a maximum value of W = 4.4 eV at photon energies around 6 eV, and a linear relation W = hv (one electron per photon) for photon energies below 4 eV. For GaAsP, we obtained a constant value of W = 4.58 eV in the photon energy range from 150 to 1500 eV, with a relative uncertainty of 1-3%, depending on the photon energy.},

It accounts for the spectral properties of the subcells as well as their reduced operating temperature due to increased efficiency and luminescent coupling. Inputs are the experimental I-V and QE data of the subcells (e.g., available from laboratory prototypes) and the irradiance-dependent module temperature of the bottom cell. We apply the model to compare two types of tandem cells, GaInP and GaAs top cells on Si bottom cells. The impact of the temperature model, compared to a constant temperature, shows a relative change in energy yield of up to 2.7%rel. Including luminescent coupling for GaAs/Si devices with two terminals, increases the energy yield by 34.0%rel. This is still 34.2%rel less energy yielded than for GaInP/Si two-terminal devices. The performance of the GaInP/Si devices can be improved by 5.8%rel using three-terminal devices with back-contacted bottom cells instead of a two-terminal configuration under the assumption of a cell string with voltage matching of one top cell with two bottom cells. For GaInP/Si, the three-terminal device performs similarly to the four-terminal device, enabling the integration of monolithic tandem cells into modules at comparably high efficiencies.},

Unlike for conventional devices, stretchable electronics can cover arbitrary surfaces and movable parts. However, a large hurdle is the manufacture of large-area highly stretchable electrical wirings with high conductivity. Here, we describe the manufacture of printable elastic conductors comprising single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) uniformly dispersed in a fluorinated rubber. Using an ionic liquid and jet-milling, we produce long and fine SWNT bundles that can form well-developed conducting networks in the rubber. Conductivity of more than 100 S cm 1 and stretchability of more than 100% are obtained. Making full use of this extraordinary conductivity, we constructed a rubber-like stretchable active-matrix display comprising integrated printed elastic conductors, organic transistors and organic light-emitting diodes. The display could be stretched by 30-50% and spread over a hemisphere without any mechanical or electrical damage. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Thermal management has been an important issue for both one-sun flat-plate, and concentration system applications. It is well known that system output power, or efficiency, decreases with the increasing temperature of the cell incorporated within the system mainly due to a decrease in open-circuit voltage (Voc) as a function of increasing temperature. This paper reports the measurement results of temperature sensitivity for Voc of AMONIX's high-concentration photovoltaic (HCPV) cells at various temperatures (25° C - 65° C), and various concentration levels (one-sun up to 500 suns under AM1.5) and compares against typical one-sun flat-plate manufacturer's data. Even after taking into account the negative temperature dependence of the Fill Factor, the study shows that output power in concentration systems is less affected by temperature variations compared to one-sun flat-plate designs. The overall effect of this reduced temperature sensitivity for Voc of the HCPV cell on the power output at operating temperature is analyzed and compared against typical single and poly-crystalline silicon, front-junction, one-sun, flat-plate manufacturer's data. Experimental and analytical results show that typical flat-plate systems have a -0.4%/°C (4000 PPM) decrease in power versus -0.25%/°C (2500 PPM) for high-concentration systems.},

One of the obstacles is given by the present high production costs of PV modules. A possibility to reduce costs are thin-film PV modules on glass. The specific option of thin-film silicon is considered. The combination of amorphous and microcrystalline silicon thin films within a tandem solar cell corresponds to a theoretical optimum. In practice, stabilized efficiencies of 10% to 12% have so far been obtained in the laboratory with such tandem solar cells. Silicon being a material with an indirect band gap, its absorption coefficient is relatively low, and therefore light management in the solar cell has to be further optimized. Thin-film silicon can be deposited by plasma-enhanced CVD, as used for AM-LCD displays. The use of modified fabrication equipment from the AM-LCD Display Industry is therefore a promising way to implement low-cost mass production. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The capacitance-voltage (C–V), dark current-voltage (I–V) and impedance spectroscopy (IS) analysis were carried out to explain the active layer thickness dependence on the photovoltaic performance. The OSC with an active layer thickness of 150 nm achieved the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.87%, while the OSC of 200 nm active layer thickness yielded the worst PCE. Reduction in the fill factor (FF) was the main reason for the reduction in the PCE at large active layer thickness. The dark I–V analysis revealed large defect density for the OSC with active layer thickness of 200 nm, which raised the charge recombination and leakage current and consequently reduced the FF. IS analysis predicted that the charge transport became the serious limitations for the OSC with 200 nm thick active layer, which can be attributed to the weakening of electric field as well as creation of field-free regions. It mainly caused a drastic drop in the fill factor by reducing the charge collection efficiency, consequently deteriorated the photovoltaic performance.},

Herein, Ag/Au alloy nanoparticles and photonic crystals (PCs) were simultaneously introduced into ST-PSCs, acting compatibly as localized surface plasmon resonances and distributed Bragg reflectors to enhance light absorption and transmission. As a result, ST-PSCs based on a hybrid PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer contribute an efficiency as high as 7.13 ± 0.15% and an average visible transmission beyond 20%, which are superior to most of the reported results. Furthermore, PCs can partly compensate valley range of transmission by balancing reflection and transmission regions, yielding a high color rendering index of 95. We believe that the idea of two light management methods compatibly enhancing the performance of ST-PSCs can offer a promising path to develop photovoltaic applications.},

   abstract = {<p>With an attempt to achieve high-density fine organic stripes for potential applications in solution-processable organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), we have performed slot-die coatings using a shim with slit channels in various shapes (rectangular-shaped narrow, rectangular-shaped wide, and reversely tapered channels) in the presence of narrow µ-tips. Based on hydraulic-electric circuit analogy, we have analyzed the fluid dynamics of an aqueous poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly (4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). It is observed that the coating speed can be increased and the stripe width can be reduced using a shim with rectangular-shaped wide slit channels. It is attributed that the hydraulic resistance is decreased and thus more fluid can reach a substrate through µ-tips. This behavior is consistent with the simulation result of the equivalent electrical circuit with a DC voltage source representing a pressure source. Using the shim with 150-µm-wide slit channels, we have successfully fabricated 200 PEDOT:PSS stripes within the effective coating width (150 mm) and 160 OLED stripes (34 stripes per inch) with the luminance of 325 cd/m2 at 5 V.</p>},

Efficiencies at the matched loads have been calculated with band gap and fc as parameters, the sun and cell being assumed to be blackbodies with temperatures of 6000°K and 300°K, respectively. The maximum efficiency is found to be 30% for an energy gap of 1.1 ev and fc = 1.

   abstract = {Organic photodetectors (OPDs) have gained increasing interest as they offer cost-effective fabrication methods using low temperature processes, making them particularly attractive for large area image detectors on lightweight flexible plastic substrates. Moreover, their photophysical and optoelectronic properties can be tuned both at a material and device level. Visible-light OPDs are proposed for use in indirect-conversion X-ray detectors, fingerprint scanners, and intelligent surfaces for gesture recognition. Near-infrared OPDs find applications in biomedical imaging and optical communications. For most applications, minimizing the OPD dark current density (Jd) is crucial to improve important figures of merits such as the signal-to-noise ratio, the linear dynamic range, and the specific detectivity (D*). Here, a quantitative analysis of the intrinsic dark current processes shows that charge injection from the electrodes is the dominant contribution to Jd in OPDs. Jd reduction is typically addressed by fine-tuning the active layer energetics and stratification or by using charge blocking layers. Yet, most experimental Jd values are higher than the calculated intrinsic limit. Possible reasons for this deviation are discussed, including extrinsic defects in the photoactive layer and the presence of trap states. This provides the reader with guidelines to improve the OPD performances in view of imaging applications.},

Here, a systematic analysis of Jd in state-of-the-art BHJ OPDs using five polymers with a range of energy levels and charge transport characteristics is presented.

   abstract = {This paper investigates, theoretically, the temperature dependence of the performance of solar cells in the temperature range 273-523 K. The solar cell performance is determined by its parameters, viz., short circuit current density (J sc), open circuit voltage (V oc), fill factor (FF) and efficiency (η). Solar cells based on semiconductor materials such as Ge, Si, GaAs, InP, CdTe and CdS are considered here. Reverse saturation current density (J o) is an important diode parameter which controls the change in performance parameters with temperature. In this work, reverse saturation current density (J o=C.T 3.exp (-qE g/kT)) is determined for three cases. Cases (I) and (II) correspond to C=17.90 and 50 mA cm -2 K 3 respectively, whereas, case (III) corresponds to C.T 3=A=1.5×10 8 mA cm -2. The maximum achievable V oc, J sc, FF and η of solar cells are calculated for AM1.5G and AM0 spectra and are compared with theoretical and experimental results in the literature. Highest V oc, FF and η are achieved for case (III). The performance of cells for case (III) gives the best agreement between the calculated and available theoretical and experimental data for solar cells based on the materials, Si, Ge, GaAs whereas, for InP, CdTe and CdS, case (I) seems to be more appropriate at 298 K. Moreover, as temperature changes, cases (I) and (II) are more suitable to describe the performance of solar cells. The rate of change of performance parameters with temperature, viz., dJ sc/dT, dV oc/dT, dFF/dT and dη/dT are calculated and compared with the available data in the literature. In addition to theoretical results, the experimentally determined performance parameters of silicon solar cells and their rate of change with temperature are also presented. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells based on low bandgap polymer:fullerene blends are promising for next generation low-cost photovoltaics. While these solution-processed solar cells are compatible with large-scale roll-to-roll processing, active layers used for typical laboratory-scale devices are too thin to ensure high manufacturing yields. Furthermore, due to the limited light absorption and optical interference within the thin active layer, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells are severely limited. In order to produce polymer solar cells with high yields, efficient solar cells with a thick active layer must be demonstrated. In this work, the performance of thick-film solar cells employing the low-bandgap polymer poly(dithienogermole-thienopyrrolodione) (PDTG-TPD) was demonstrated. Power conversion efficiencies over 8.0% were obtained for devices with an active layer thickness of 200 nm, illustrating the potential of this polymer for large-scale manufacturing. Although an average EQE > 65% was obtained for devices with active layer thicknesses > 200 nm, the cell performance could not be maintained due to a reduction in fill factor. By comparing our results for PDTG-TPD solar cells with similar P3HT-based devices, we investigated the loss mechanisms associated with the limited device performance observed for thick-film low-bandgap polymer solar cells. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Underlying the treatment are two simplifying assumptions: namely, ( <italic>a</italic> ) that the lattice can be approximately treated as a dielectric continuum; ( <italic>b</italic> ) that in obtaining the vibrational wave functions for the lattice, the effect of the <italic>F</italic> -centre can be considered as that of a static charge distribution. Under these assumptions, it is shown that the absorption constant as a function of frequency and temperature can be expressed in terms of the Bessel functions with imaginary arguments. The theoretical curves for the absorption constant compare very favourably with the experimental curves for all temperatures. Also considered in the paper are the probabilities of non-radiative transitions, which are important in connexion with the photo-conductivity observed following light absorption by <italic>F</italic> -centres. The treatment given differs from the qualitative considerations hitherto in one important aspect, namely, the strength of the coupling between the electron and the lattice is taken into account. The adiabatic wave functions for the <italic>F</italic> -centre electron required for the discussion are obtained by perturbation methods. The probability for an excited <italic>F</italic> -centre to return to its ground state by non-radiative transitions is shown to be negligible; similar transitions to the conduction band are, however, important if the excited state is separated from the conduction band by not much more than 0·1 eV.

Experimental data recorded during a year are employed to check the accuracy of the proposed hypothesis and the original method (suggestion of the 61215 standard, where one temperature is considered for the whole module). Comparison of the both hourly and monthly profiles of performance criteria shows that the proposed hypothesis is much more accurate than the original method. It is found that in July, as the sample month for which the hourly profiles are investigated, the average values of the error in prediction of efficiency, produced power, and generated energy are 5.70, 7.72, and 6.07% for the original approach whereas using the proposed hypothesis reduces them to only 1.45, 1.75, and 1.35%, respectively.

This polymer exhibits p-channel charge transport characteristics when used as the active semiconductor in organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) devices. The hole mobilities of 0.65 cm2 V-1 s-1 and 0.98 cm2 V -1 s-1 are achieved respectively in bottom gate and dual gate OTFT devices with on/off ratios in the range of 105 to 10 7. Additionally, due to its appropriate HOMO (5.29 eV) energy level and optimum optical band gap (1.50 eV), PDPP-TNT is a promising candidate for organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications. When this polymer semiconductor is used as a donor and PC71BM as an acceptor in OPV devices, high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 4.7% are obtained. Such high mobility values in OTFTs and high PCE in OPV make PDPP-TNT a very promising polymer semiconductor for a wide range of applications in organic electronics. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

It begins by briefly detailing the separate components of the nuclear fuel cycle before explaining the methodology of the survey and exploring the variance of lifecycle estimates. It calculates that while the range of emissions for nuclear energy over the lifetime of a plant, reported from qualified studies examined, is from 1.4 g of carbon dioxide equivalent per kWh (g CO2e/kWh) to 288 g CO2e/kWh, the mean value is 66 g CO2e/kWh. The article then explains some of the factors responsible for the disparity in lifecycle estimates, in particular identifying errors in both the lowest estimates (not comprehensive) and the highest estimates (failure to consider co-products). It should be noted that nuclear power is not directly emitting greenhouse gas emissions, but rather that lifecycle emissions occur through plant construction, operation, uranium mining and milling, and plant decommissioning. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {In this paper an overview of the development of organic photovoltaics is given, with emphasis on polymer-based solar cells. The observation of photoconductivity in solid anthracene in the beginning of the 19th century marked the start of this field. The first real investigations of photovoltaic (PV) devices came in the 1950s, where a number of organic dyes, particularly chlorophyll and related compounds, were studied. In the 1980s the first polymers (including poly(sulphur nitride) and polyacetylene) were investigated in PV cells. However, simple PV devices based on dyes or polymers yield limited power conversion efficiencies (PCE), typically well below 0.1%. A major breakthrough came in 1986 when Tang discovered that bringing a donor and an acceptor together in one cell could dramatically increase the PCE to 1%. This concept of heterojunction has since been widely exploited in a number of donor-acceptor cells, including dye/dye, polymer/dye, polymer/polymer and polymer/fullerene blends. Due to the high electron affinity of fullerene, polymer/fullerene blends have been subject to particular investigation during the past decade. Earlier problems in obtaining efficient charge carrier separation have been overcome and PCE of more than 3% have been reported. Different strategies have been used to gain better control over the morphology and further improve efficiency. Among these, covalent attachment of fullerenes to the polymer backbone, creating so-called double-cable polymers, is the latest. The improved PCE of plastic solar cells combined with increased (shelf and operating) lifetime, superior material properties and available manufacturing techniques may push plastic PVs to the market place within a few years. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The use of 3D printing has rapidly expanded in the past couple of years. It is now possible to produce 3D-printed objects with exceptionally high fidelity and precision. However, although the quality of 3D printing has improved, both the time to print and the material costs have remained high. Moreover, there is no guarantee that a printed model is structurally sound. The printed product often does not survive cleaning, transportation, or handling, or it may even collapse under its own weight. We present a system that addresses this issue by providing automatic detection and correction of the problematic cases. The structural problems are detected by combining a lightweight structural analysis solver with 3D medial axis approximations. After areas with high structural stress are found, the model is corrected by combining three approaches: hollowing, thickening, and strut insertion. Both detection and correction steps are repeated until the problems have been eliminated. Our process is designed to create a model that is visually similar to the original model but possessing greater structural integrity. © 2012 ACM 0730-0301/2012/08-ART48.},

In this simulation study, we investigated the relationship between the refractive index of front-side coupling structures on top of planar wafer-based crystalline silicon solar cells and the light-trapping performance of the structures. A crossed diffraction grating with a period of 1  μm and random pyramid structures with varying refractive indices were considered. Simulations were carried out both at the cell level and at the complete module stack level. It is shown that the single pass light path enhancement factor (LPEF) only provides a rough estimate of the light-trapping properties. The light-trapping behavior can only be reliably assessed in the complete system level and these results deviate from the estimated single pass LPEF. It can also be shown that the refractive index of the structure strongly influences the light-trapping behavior.},

A MATLAB/Simulink model on cell level is developed for comparing the output energy of the different circuits to the theoretical maximum. It is shown that for power optimizers even small amounts of shading reduce the output energy significantly. Based on these results, the so called submodule concept is introduced, which overcomes these drawbacks. By integrating ASICs into the PV modules, the number of series connected solar cells is decreased, while additional costs are kept low and high reliability is maintained. The submodule concept provides the largest output energy improvement for low amounts of shading. From an economic point of view this is the most important operating area, since the theoretical harvestable energy decreases with increasing shading. Therefore, the submodule concept is a good and economic solution for increasing the overall energy yield of PV installations. © 2012 IEEE.},

Organic photodiodes are particularly well suited for such technologies as they enable chemically tailored optoelectronic performance and fabrication by printing techniques on thin and flexible substrates. However, previous methods have failed to address versatile functionality regarding wavelength selectivity without increasing fabrication complexity. This work introduces a general solution for printing wavelength-selective bulk-heterojunction photodetectors through engineering of the ink formulation. Nonfullerene acceptors are incorporated in a transparent polymer donor matrix to narrow and tune the response in the visible range without optical filters or light-management techniques. This approach effectively decouples the optical response from the viscoelastic ink properties, simplifying process development. A thorough morphological and spectroscopic investigation finds excellent charge-carrier dynamics enabling state-of-the-art responsivities >102 mA W−1 and cutoff frequencies >1.5 MHz. Finally, the color selectivity and high performance are demonstrated in a filterless visible-light-communication system capable of demultiplexing intermixed optical signals.},

One of the biggest opportunities for such technologies is in their integration as windows and skylights within energy-sustainable buildings. Currently, such building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are dominated by crystalline silicon based modules; however, the opaque nature of silicon creates a unique opportunity for the adoption of emerging photovoltaic candidates that can be made truly semi-transparent. These include: amorphous silicon-, kesterite-, chalcopyrite-, CdTe-, dye-sensitized-, organic- and perovskite- based systems. For the most part, amorphous silicon has been the workhorse in the semi-transparent solar cell field owing to its established, low-temperature fabrication processes. Excitement around alternative classes, particularly perovskites and the inorganic candidates, has recently arisen because of the major efficiency gains exhibited by these technologies. Importantly, each of these presents unique opportunities and challenges within the context of BIPV.

The active layer consists of a diketopyrrolopyrrole-based donor molecule (DPP(TBFu)2) and a fullerene derivative (PC71BM) that is spin cast and subsequently treated with solvent vapor annealing (SVA) in air. We find not all solvent vapors lead to the best PCE. Solvents of high vapor pressures and medium donor solubilities, such as tetrahydrofuran or carbon disulfide, are most suitable for SVA in the context of organic solar cell application. On the other hand, acceptor solubility plays an insignificant role in such a treatment. An active layer treated with ideal solvent vapors develops desirable phase separation in both lateral and vertical directions, as revealed by AFM, TEM and TEM tomography. The SVA also leads to enhanced hole mobility. We believe the fast SVA treatment performed in air is a viable way to tune the active layer morphology for printed solar cells. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.},

The simulations reveal important details of the charge separation process: the exciton in the donor polymer first dissociates into a "hot" charge transfer state, which is best described as a polaron pair. The polaron pair can be separated into free polaron charge carriers if a sufficiently strong external electric field is applied. We have also studied the effects of inter-chain interaction, temperature, and the external electric field strength. Increasing inter-chain interactions makes it easier for the exciton to dissociate into a polaron pair state, but more difficult for the polaron pair to dissociate into free charge carriers. Higher temperature and higher electric field strength both favor exciton dissociation as well as the formation of free charge carriers. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

   abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) is a fast growing segment among renewable energy (RE) systems, whose development is owed to depleting fossil fuel and climate-changing environmental pollution. PV power output capacity, however, is still low and the associated costs still high, so efforts continue to develop PV converter and its controller, aiming for higher power-extracting efficiency and cost effectiveness. Different algorithms have been proposed for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). Since the choice of right converter for different application has an important influence in the optimum performance of the photovoltaic system, this paper reviews the state-of-the-art in research works on non-isolated DC-DC buck, boost, buck-boost, Cúk and SEPIC converters and their characteristics, to find a solution best suiting an application with Maximum Power Point Tracking. Review shows that there is a limitation in the system's performance according to the type of converter used. In can be concluded that the best selection of DC-DC converter which is really suitable and applicable in the PV system is the buck-boost DC-DC converter since it is capable of achieving optimal operation regardless of the load value with negotiable performance efficiency and price issue. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Spectroscopic photodetection is a powerful tool in disciplines such as medical diagnosis, industrial process monitoring, or agriculture. However, its application in novel fields, including wearable and biointegrated electronics, is hampered by the use of bulky dispersive optics. Here, solution-processed organic donor–acceptor blends are employed in a resonant optical cavity device architecture for wavelength-tunable photodetection. While conventional photodetectors respond to above-gap excitation, the cavity device exploits weak subgap absorption of intermolecular charge-transfer states of the intercalating poly[2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PBTTT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bimolecular crystal. This enables a highly wavelength selective, near-infrared photoresponse with a spectral resolution down to 14 nm, as well as dark currents and detectivities comparable with commercial inorganic photodetectors. Based on this concept, a miniaturized spectrophotometer, comprising an array of narrowband cavity photodetectors, is fabricated by using a blade-coated PBTTT:PCBM thin film with a thickness gradient. As an application example, a measurement of the transmittance spectrum of water by this device is demonstrated.},

   abstract = {To maximize the short-circuit current density (JSC) and the open circuit voltage (VOC) simultaneously is a highly important but challenging issue in organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, a benzotriazole-based p-type polymer (J61) and three benzotriazole-based nonfullerene small molecule acceptors (BTA1-3) are chosen to investigate the energetic driving force for the efficient charge transfer. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of small molecule acceptors can be fine-tuned by modifying the end-capping units, leading to high VOC (1.15–1.30 V) of OSCs. Particularly, the LUMO energy level of BTA3 satisfies the criteria for efficient charge generation, which results in a high VOC of 1.15 V, nearly 65% external quantum efficiency, and a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.25%. This is one of the highest VOC in the high-performance OSCs reported to date. The results imply that it is promising to achieve both high JSC and VOC to realize high PCE with the carefully designed nonfullerene acceptors.},

   abstract = {The macrocrystalline chlorophyll-a film prepared by the method of electrodeposition is shown to have strong photovoltaic effects. The photovoltaic cell (M1|Chl|M2) has lamellar arrangement with the Chl-a film sandwiched between two metal electrodes. With dissimilar electrodes of different work functions, φM the cell usually exhibits a dark rectification behavior. A large forward bias current is seen when the metal with a lower φM is the negative electrode. The rectification is small when the same metal is used as both electrodes. A blocking contact or Schottky barrier is evidently present at the Chl-a|metal junction particularly for the metal having a low φM. A p-type semiconduction in Chl-a is implicated. In the photovoltaic mode, cells such as (Al|Chl|Hg) and (Al|Chl|Au) have an open circuit voltage ranging from 200-500 mV. The power conversion efficiency for these cells is on the order of 10-3% which is among the highest in photovoltaic cells using organic materials. The direction of the photovoltaic current and the shape of its action spectrum are strongly dependent on the electrode materials. The blocking contact at the Chl-a|metal junction is primarily responsible for the photovoltaic activity of the cell. When this blocking contact is established at the directly illuminated electrode the action spectrum closely matches the absorption spectrum of the Chl-a film. An inverse type response is found when the blocking contact is at the indirectly illuminated electrode with the Chl-a layer essentially acting as an inner filter. The photocurrent is shown to increase when the cell is reverse biased. A minimum quantum yield for charge generation of about 0.03 is found in (Al|Chl|Hg) and (Al|Chl|Au) cells.

   abstract = {<p>We present a concept design of a solar spectrum splitting system that enables highly-concentrated solar energy harvesting over the entire AM1.5 spectral range. After passing through an array of the dispersive optical system (DOS) module composed of a grating structure and dispersive prisms below a concentrating lens, incident sunlight can be separated into two wavelength bands of visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) ranges, which can then be focused onto corresponding solar receivers. Based on the spectral response of typical crystalline silicon solar cells, the VIS wavelength band is selected from 0.4 μm to 1.2 μm to contribute to photovoltaic (PV) conversion to generate electricity. Meanwhile, the IR band in longer wavelength ranges (1.2 μm ≤ λ ≤ 2.5 μm), which does not contribute to PV conversion, can be simultaneously used for solar thermal applications such as water heating and thermoelectricity. In this paper, various design parameters (e.g., focal length of a concentrating lens, groove density of a grating, geometry of dispersive prisms, material combination of optical components, etc.) have been investigated to determine an optimum set of system configurations, using optical design software (Zemax OpticStudio 14.2). Our simulation studies validate that the DOS is able to split incident AM1.5 solar irradiance into the two wavelength bands of the VIS and IR ranges and focus each wavelength band with concentration factors as high as 798× and 755× on the same focal plane, respectively. Such high concentration factors for both wavelength bands can be actualized due to the additional optical components used—a grating structure and dispersive prisms, which allow to minimize optical aberrations through both diffraction and refraction. The proposed DOS, designed with commercially available optical components, has the potential to widen the use of the sun’s spectrum by allowing effective PV conversion of solar cells under high concentration with tolerable optical system losses and concurrently converting the remaining solar irradiation into useful energy for a broad range of thermal applications.</p>},

Here we explore whether negative emissions are indeed effective in reversing climate change on human timescales, given the potentially counteracting effect of natural carbon sinks and the inertia of the climate system. We designed a range of CO2 emission scenarios, which follow a gradual transition to a zero-carbon energy system and entail implementation of various amounts of net-negative emissions at technologically plausible rates. These scenarios are used to force an Earth System Model of intermediate complexity. Results suggest that while it is possible to revert to a desired level of warming (e.g. 2 °C above pre-industrial) after different levels of overshoot, thermosteric sea level rise is not reversible for at least several centuries, even under assumption of large amounts of negative CO2 emissions. During the net-negative emission phase, artificial CO2 removal is opposed by CO2 outgassing from natural carbon sinks, with the efficiency of CO2 removal - here defined as the drop in atmospheric CO2 per unit negative emission - decreasing with the total amount of negative emissions.},

When locating the light trapping element, that displays strong directional asymmetric transmission, in front of thin film organic photovoltaic cells, an increase in cell absorption is obtained. By recycling reflected photons that otherwise would be lost, thinner films with more beneficial electrical properties can effectively be deployed. The light trapping element enhances the absorption rate of the solar cell and increases the photocurrent by as much as 25%.},

   abstract = {In this article we report the weak but omnipresent electroluminescence (EL) from several types of organic polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells biased in the forward direction. The light emitted from blends of some commonly used polymers and the fullerene molecule is significantly different from that of any of the pure materials comprising the blend. The lower energy of the blend EL is found to correlate with both the voltage onset of emission and the open-circuit voltage of the photovoltaic cell under solar illumination. We accordingly interpret the emission to originate from interfacial charge transfer state recombination and emphasize EL as a very valuable tool to characterize the charge transfer state present in donor/acceptor organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Intermolecular charge-transfer states at the interface between electron donating (D) and accepting (A) materials are crucial for the operation of organic solar cells but can also be exploited for organic light-emitting diodes 1,2 . Non-radiative charge-transfer state decay is dominant in state-of-the-art D–A-based organic solar cells and is responsible for large voltage losses and relatively low power-conversion efficiencies as well as electroluminescence external quantum yields in the 0.01–0.0001% range 3,4 . In contrast, the electroluminescence external quantum yield reaches up to 16% in D–A-based organic light-emitting diodes 5–7 . Here, we show that proper control of charge-transfer state properties allows simultaneous occurrence of a high photovoltaic and emission quantum yield within a single, visible-light-emitting D–A system. This leads to ultralow-emission turn-on voltages as well as significantly reduced voltage losses upon solar illumination. These results unify the description of the electro-optical properties of charge-transfer states in organic optoelectronic devices and foster the use of organic D–A blends in energy conversion applications involving visible and ultraviolet photons 8–11 .},

   abstract = {Charge carrier mobilities of organic semiconductors are often characterized using steady-state measurements of space charge limited diodes. These measurements assume that charge carriers are in a steady-state equilibrium. In reality, however, energetically hot carriers are introduces by photo-excitation and injection into highly energetic sites from the electrodes. These carriers perturb the equilibrium density of occupied states, and therefore change the overall charge transport properties. In this paper, we look into the effect of energetically hot carriers on the charge transport in organic semiconductors using steady state kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. For injected hot carriers in a typical organic semiconductor, rapid energetic relaxation occurs in the order of tens of nanoseconds, which is much faster than the typical transit time of a charge carrier throught the device. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of photo-generated carriers on the steady-state mobility. For a typical organic voltaic material, an increase in mobility of a factor of 1.1 is found. Therefore, we conclude that the impact of energetically hot carriers on normal device operation is limited.},

Efficient organic solar cells require a high yield for this process, combined with a minimum of energy losses. Here, we investigate the role of the lowest energy emissive interfacial charge-transfer state (CT1) in the charge generation process. We measure the quantum yield and the electric field dependence of charge generation on excitation of the charge-transfer (CT) state manifold via weakly allowed, low-energy optical transitions. For a wide range of photovoltaic devices based on polymer:fullerene, small-molecule:C60 and polymer:polymer blends, our study reveals that the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is essentially independent of whether or not D, A or CT states with an energy higher than that of CT1 are excited. The best materials systems show an IQE higher than 90% without the need for excess electronic or vibrational energy. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

   abstract = {Photocurrent generation by charge-transfer (CT) absorption is detected in a range of conjugated polymer-[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) based solar cells. The low intensity CT absorption bands are observed using a highly sensitive measurement of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum by means of Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS). The presence of these CT bands implies the formation of weak ground-state charge-transfer complexes in the studied polymer-fullerene blends. The effective band gap (Eg) of the material blends used in these photovoltaic devices is determined from the energetic onset of the photocurrent generated by CT absorption. It is shown that for all devices, under various preparation conditions, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) scales linearly with Eg. The redshift of the CT band upon thermal annealing of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene):PCBM and thermal aging of poly(phenylenevinylene)(PPV):PCBM photovoltaic devices correlates with the observed drop in open-circuit voltage of high-temperature treated versus untreated devices. Increasing the weight fraction of PCBM also results in a redshift of Eg, proportional with the observed changes in V oc for different PPV:PCBM ratios. As Eg corresponds with the effective bandgap of the material blends, a measurement of the EQE spectrum by FTPS allows us to measure this energy directly on photovoltaic devices, and makes it a valuable technique in the study of organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Besides the produced current, the overall efficiency depends critically on the generated photovoltage. Therefore, understanding and optimization of the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of organic solar cells is of high importance. Here, we demonstrate that charge-transfer absorption and emission are shown to be related to each other and Voc in accordance with the assumptions of the detailed balance and quasi-equilibrium theory. We underline the importance of the weak ground-state interaction between the polymer and the fullerene and we confirm that Voc is determined by the formation of these states.

'Planet' results demonstrate that the incompatibility of nuclear expansion with electricity efficiency and full renewable power deployment largely overshadows the carbon-free steam generation of nuclear fission. 'Prosperity' analyses show that including rolled-off costs and risks would raise bills to heights difficult to quantify due to doubts, long-term invisibility and irreversibility. 'Risks' may be catastrophic and are not insurable, while weaponry proliferation adds a further dimension. 'People' analyses reveal that some nuclear power is affordable for present generations when many costs remain unpaid; however, developing countries cannot afford the capital costs and technology intensity, and catastrophes wreak havoc on national economies, singling out exposed communities losing their habitats. 'Politics' assessments demonstrate that nuclear technocracy dominates the scene in many countries; the technocrats heavily influence policy-makers, the media, and celebrities speaking out in favor of nuclear.

A custom-built heating chamber for in situ GIXS studies allows for the morphological characterization of thin films at elevated temperatures. Films annealed with a thermal gradient allow for the rapid investigation of the morphology over a range of temperatures that corroborate the results of the in situ experiments. Using these techniques the following are observed: the melting points of each component; an increase in the P3HT coherence length with annealing below the P3HT melting temperature; the formation of well-oriented P3HT crystallites with the (100) plane parallel to the substrate, when cooled from the melt; and the cold crystallization of PCBM associated with the PCBM glass transition temperature. The incorporation of these materials into BHJ blends affects the nature of these transitions as a function of blend ratio.

For example, higher light-harvesting efficiency can lead to higher photocurrent in solar cells that are limited by sub-optimal electrical transport. Here, we compare over 40 conjugated polymers, and find that many different chemical structures share an apparent maximum in their extinction coefficients. However, a diketopyrrolopyrrole-thienothiophene copolymer shows remarkably high optical absorption at relatively low photon energies. By investigating its backbone structure and conformation with measurements and quantum chemical calculations, we find that the high optical absorption can be explained by the high persistence length of the polymer. Accordingly, we demonstrate high absorption in other polymers with high theoretical persistence length. Visible light harvesting may be enhanced in other conjugated polymers through judicious design of the structure.},

Given these three points, which are provided by all commercial array datasheets, the method finds the best I-V equation for the single-diode photovoltaic (PV) model including the effect of the series and parallel resistances, and warranties that the maximum power of the model matches with the maximum power of the real array. With the parameters of the adjusted I-V equation, one can build a PV circuit model with any circuit simulator by using basic math blocks. The modeling method and the proposed circuit model are useful for power electronics designers who need a simple, fast, accurate, and easy-to-use modeling method for using in simulations of PV systems. In the first pages, the reader will find a tutorial on PV devices and will understand the parameters that compose the single-diode PV model. The modeling method is then introduced and presented in details. The model is validated with experimental data of commercial PV arrays. © 2009 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to understand how printing parameters and subsequent annealing impacts porosity and crystallinity of 3D printed polylactic acid (PLA) and how these structural characteristics impact the printed material’s tensile strength in various build directions. Design/methodology/approach Two experimental studies were used, and samples with a flat vs upright print orientation were compared. The first experiment investigates a scan of printing parameters and annealing times and temperatures above the cold crystallization temperature (Tcc) for PLA. The second experiment investigates annealing above and below Tcc at multiple points over 12 h. Findings Annealing above Tcc does not significantly impact the porosity but it does increase crystallinity. The increase in crystallinity does not contribute to an increase in strength, suggesting that co-crystallization across the weld does not occur. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images show that weld interfaces between printed fibers are still visible after annealing above Tcc, confirming the lack of co-crystallization. Annealing below Tcc does not significantly impact porosity or crystallinity. However, there is an increase in tensile strength. AFM images show that annealing below Tcc reduces thermal stresses that form at the interfaces during printing and slightly “heals” the as-printed interface resulting in an increase in tensile strength. Originality/value While annealing has been explored in the literature, it is unclear how it affects porosity, crystallinity and thermal stresses in fused filament fabrication PLA and how those factors contribute to mechanical properties. This study explains how co-crystallization across weld interfaces is necessary for crystallinity to increase strength and uses AFM as a technique to observe morphology at the weld.},

   abstract = {\nThermodynamic principles limit the conversion efficiency of a single bandgap organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell to 33%1 . In order to increase efficiency, multiple OPV devices can be combined to cover a larger spectral range of the incident solar spectrum. The most common way of doing this is to mount multiple bandgap cells in tandem or series. However, stacked multijunction systems have limitations, such as current-matching constraints and optical quality of the OPV layer. A separated arrangement with spectrum splitting is a promising alternative to the stacked tandem approach. In this paper, two organic photovoltaic cells with complementary EQE curves are integrated into a holographic spectrum splitting module. The highest possible conversion efficiency of this two-cell combination is quantified assuming an ideal spectral filter as a reference. A spectrum splitting module is built, consisting of a reflective hologram oriented at an angle to split the incident beam into two spectral bands. The holographic beamsplitting system is assembled and studied under a solar simulator. Power output and conversion efficiency of the holographic spectrum splitting system is evaluated in terms of Improvement over Best Bandgap (IoBB) of the two-cell combination. The combined system has a measured improvement over its best single cell of 12.30% under a solar simulator lamp and a predicted improvement of 16.39% under sunlight.\n},

The model takes into account the fact that a particular cell is not only illuminated by part of the solar irradiance but also by the electroluminescence of other cells of the set. Whereas, under 1 sun irradiance, a single solar cell only converts 30% of the solar energy, a tandem structure of two cells can convert 42%, a tandem structure of three cells can convert 49 %, etc. Under the highest possible light concentration , these efficiencies are 40% (one cell), 55 % (two cells), 63 % (three cells), etc. The model also allows us to predict the ideal efficiency of a stack with an infinite number of solar cells. Such a tandem system can convert 68% of the unconcentrated sunlight, and 86% of the concentrated sunlight.},

The samples are manufactured by fused deposition modeling (FDM) at different temperatures and subsequently evaluated by three-point bending flexural and tensile tests. The polymer processed at 215 °C is thermally annealed over its glass transition temperature in order to increase the degree of crystallinity to the maximum attainable level as measured by the differential scanning calorimetry and confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The increase in the degree of crystallinity of FDM-PLA enhances flexural stress of the samples by 11–17%. The study also demonstrates applicability of radiation sterilization for FDM-PLA parts. Therefore, thermal annealing might be introduced into a standard RM technology of PLA, particularly for sterilizable customized implants, to efficiently improve their mechanical properties.},

In particular, it is shown that the glass transition temperature of a PCDTBT:PC 70BM blend thin-film is not sensitive to the relative blend-ratio or film thickness (at 1:4 blending ratio), but is sensitive to casting solvent and the type of substrate on which it is deposited. It is found that the glass transition temperature of the blend reduces on annealing; an observation consistent with disruption of π-π stacking between PCDTBT molecules. Reduced π-π stacking is correlated with reduced hole-mobility in thermally annealed films. It is suggested that this explains the failure of such annealing protocols to substantially improve device-efficiency. The annealing studies demonstrate that the blend only undergoes coarse phase-separation when annealed at or above 155 °C, suggesting a promising degree of morphological stability of PCDTBT:PC 70BM blends. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

By adjusting the ratio of 2-CP/ODCB in the top PC71BM layers, the resulting SSP PPD shows a decreased dark current and an increased photocurrent, leading to a maximum detectivity of 1.23 × 1012 Jones at a wavelength of 550 nm. This value is 5.3-fold higher than that of the conventional bulk heterojunction PPD. Morphology studies reveal that the PC71BM partially penetrates the predeposited P3HT layer during the spin-coating process, resulting in an optimal three-phase morphology with one well-mixed interdiffusion P3HT/PC71BM phase in the middle of the bulk and two pure phases of P3HT and PC71BM at the two electrode sides. We show that the pure phases form high Schottky barriers (>2.0 eV) at the active layer/electrodes interface and efficiently block unfavorable reverse charge carrier injection by significantly decreasing the dark current. The interdiffussion phase enlarges the donor-acceptor interfacial area leading to a large photocurrent. We also reveal that the improved performance of SSP PPDs is also due to the enhanced optical absorption, improved P3HT crystallinity, increased charge carrier mobilities, and suppressed bimolecular recombination.},

The improved efficiency for the ternary PSCs is due to the obviously elevated short-circuit current density. Higher charge dissociation probabilities, enhanced hole and electron transports, and favorable morphology were found for the ternary blend film. After long thermal annealing at 85 °C for 168 h, a good PCE of 9.37% was still retained by the ternary PSCs, remarkably higher than 5.33–6.27% for the two binary PSCs.

Here, we reported a polymer acceptor PYT with a low optical band gap and a high absorption coefficient and established a friendly relationship between the average molecular weight (Mn) of PYT and PD-PA miscibility to get an ideal morphology. The medium Mn of PYT (PYTM) leads to the suitable PM6:PYTM pair miscibility. Consequently, the resultant device shows an impressive PCE of 13.44%, which is among the top values of all-PSCs.

   abstract = {The high cost of wafers suitable for epitaxial deposition of III-V solar cells has been a primary barrier to widespread use of these cells in low-concentration and one-sun terrestrial solar applications. A possible solution is to reuse the substrate many times, thus spreading its cost across many cells. We performed a bottom-up techno-economic analysis of three different strategies for substrate reuse in high-volume manufacturing: epitaxial lift-off, spalling, and the use of a porous germanium release layer. The analysis shows that the potential cost reduction resulting from substrate reuse is limited in all three strategies––not by the number of reuse cycles achievable, but by the costs that are incurred in each cycle to prepare the substrate for another epitaxial deposition. The dominant substrate-preparation cost component is different for each of the three strategies, and the cost-ranking of these strategies is subject to change if future developments substantially reduce the cost of epitaxial deposition.

   abstract = {This study examines the spin coating process both experimentally and from a fundamental point of view. The analysis has produced a model and a quantitative relationship between spin coating thickness and pertinent material and process variables. The model predicts that the simplest and most reproducible results occur in a region which is independent of thickness and time and is characterized by low steady state radial flow on the substrate. The model also includes a time-dependent term, shown to be important for the region of high radial flow-fluids of relatively low viscosity and process conditions of relatively high speed and! or long times. Experimentally, Newtonian-like polyamide in iso-amyl alcohol solutions was examined on large rotating substrates, and measurements showed excellent correlation with the model. The sensitivity of the spin coating process to substrate size and shape is also reported and a comparison with other data in the literature, particularly on photoresist solutions, is presented. The potential applicability of the model to non-ideal fluids is also developed.},

This review aims to give an overview of the achievements made in this timeframe toward the goal of developing high-efficiency perovskite/silicon tandem cells with sufficiently large area and long lifetime to be commercially interesting. The developments that led to the recent progress in tandem cell efficiency, as well as the factors currently still limiting their performance, including parasitic absorption, reflection losses, and the nonideal perovskite absorber layer bandgap, are discussed. Based on this discussion, guidelines for future developments are given. In addition, crucial aspects to enable the commercialization of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are reviewed, such as device stability and upscaling. Finally, economic considerations show how the number of steps and/or the costs associated to these steps for realizing the perovskite cell must be kept to a minimum to keep up with progress in the field of silicon photovoltaics.},

The coefficient of thermal expansion, the enthalpy and entropy of activation, and the pre-exponential factor of the diffusion coefficient are obtained from ab initio total energy and phonon calculations including the vibrations of all atoms. Numerical results reveal that diffusion between octahedral interstitial sites occurs along an indirect path via the metastable tetrahedral site and that both the migration enthalpy and entropy are strongly temperature dependent. However, the migration enthalpy and entropy are coupled so that the diffusion coefficient is well described by a constant activation energy, i.e., D= D0 exp [-Q (RT)], with Q=45.72, 44.09, and 43.04 kJ mol and D0 =3.84× 10-6, 2.40× 10-6, 1.77× 10-6 m2 s-1 for H, D, and T, respectively. The diffusion of deuterium and tritium is computed to be slower than that of hydrogen only at temperatures above 400 K. At lower temperatures, the order is reversed in excellent agreement with experiment. The present approach is applicable to atoms of any mass as it includes the full coupling between the vibrational modes of the diffusing atom with the host lattice. © 2008 The American Physical Society.},

However, the sensitivity values of those detectors are still far from the expectation. Recent years, surface plasmon (SP) has been considered to be an effective way to enhance the sensitivity of semiconductor based UV photodetector. When the light is matched with the resonance frequency of surface plasmon, the localized field enhancement or scattering effect will happen and thus the spectral response will be enhanced. Here, we present an overview of surface plasmon enhancing the performance of UV detectors, including the GaN, ZnO, and other wide band gap semiconductor UV detectors.

We find that the series resistance losses in 1 cm2 vs. 1 mm2 OPV cell efficiencies are significantly higher in single junction cells than tandem, triple, and four junction cells due to the lower operating voltage and higher current of the former. Using sub-electrodes to reduce series resistance, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of multi-junction cells is almost independent of area from 1 mm2 to 1 cm2. Twenty-five, 1 cm2 multi-junction cell arrays are integrated in a module and connected in a series-parallel circuit configuration. A yield of 100% with a deviation of PCE from cell to cell of <10% is achieved.

Water-dispersed organic semiconducting nanoparticles (NPs) satisfy these premises convincingly. However, the necessity of surfactants, which are inevitable for stabilizing NPs, is a major obstacle towards realizing competitive power conversion efficiencies for water-processed devices. Here, we report on a concept for minimizing the adverse impact of surfactants on solar cell performance. A poloxamer facilitates the purification of organic semiconducting NPs through stripping excess surfactants from aqueous dispersion. The use of surfactant-stripped NPs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) / non-fullerene acceptor leads to a device efficiency and stability comparable to the one from devices processed by halogenated solvents. A record efficiency of 7.5% is achieved for NP devices based on a low-band gap polymer system. This elegant approach opens an avenue that future organic photovoltaics processing may be indeed based on non-toxic water-based nanoparticle inks.},

   abstract = {3D inverse opal (3D-IO) oxides are very appealing nanostructures to be integrated into the photoelectrodes of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Due to their periodic interconnected pore network with a high pore volume fraction, they facilitate electrolyte infiltration and enhance light scattering. Nonetheless, preparing 3D-IO structures directly on nonflat DSSC electrodes is challenging. Herein, 3D-IO TiO2 structures are prepared by templating with self-assembled polymethyl methacrylate spheres on glass substrates, impregnation with a mixed TiO2:SiO2 precursor and calcination. The specific surface increases from 20.9 to 30.7 m2 g−1 after SiO2 removal via etching, which leads to the formation of mesopores. The obtained nanostructures are scraped from the substrate, processed as a paste, and deposited on photoelectrodes containing a mesoporous TiO2 layer. This procedure maintains locally the 3D-IO order. When sensitized with the novel benzothiadiazole dye YKP-88, DSSCs containing the modified photoelectrodes exhibit an efficiency of 10.35% versus 9.26% for the same devices with conventional photoelectrodes. Similarly, using the ruthenium dye N719 as sensitizer an efficiency increase from 5.31% to 6.23% is obtained. These improvements originate mainly from an increase in the photocurrent density, which is attributed to an enhanced dye loading obtained with the mesoporous 3D-IO structures due to SiO2 removal.},

These copolymers exhibit wide bandgaps over 2.07 eV and low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels below −5.35 eV, which match well with the typical low-bandgap acceptor of ITIC, resulting in a good complementary absorption from 300 to 900 nm and a low HOMO level offset (≤0.13 eV). Compared to PBDT-TDZ, PBDTS-TDZ with alkylthio side chains exhibits the stronger optical absorption, lower-lying HOMO level, and higher crystallinity. By using a single green solvent of o-xylene, PBDTS-TDZ:ITIC devices exhibit a large open-circuit voltage (Voc) up to 1.10 eV and an extremely low energy loss (Eloss) of 0.48 eV.

   abstract = {Silicon solar cells are the most established solar cell technology and are expected to dominate the market in the near future. As state-of-the-art silicon solar cells are approaching the Shockley-Queisser limit, stacking silicon solar cells with other photovoltaic materials to form multi-junction devices is an obvious pathway to further raise the efficiency. However, many challenges stand in the way of fully realizing the potential of silicon tandem solar cells because heterogeneously integrating silicon with other materials often degrades their qualities. Recently, above or near 30% silicon tandem solar cell has been demonstrated, showing the promise of achieving high-efficiency and low-cost solar cells via silicon tandem. This paper reviews the recent progress of integrating solar cell with other mainstream solar cell materials. The first part of this review focuses on the integration of silicon with III-V semiconductor solar cells, which is a long-researched topic since the emergence of III-V semiconductors. We will describe the main approaches - heteroepitaxy, wafer bonding and mechanical stacking - as well as other novel approaches. The second part introduces the integration of silicon with polycrystalline thin-film solar cells, mainly perovskites on silicon solar cells because of its rapid progress recently. We will also use an analytical model to compare the material qualities of different types of silicon tandem solar cells and project their practical efficiency limits.},

   abstract = {The charge carrier dynamics in blend films of poly[2,6-(4,4-bis(2- ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b']dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1, 3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C 61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was studied by transient absorption spectroscopy in order to address the origin of limited external quantum efficiency (EQE) of this solar cell compared to that of a benchmark solar cell composed of regioregular poly(3-hexythiphene) (RR-P3HT) and PCBM. Upon photoexcitation, PCPDTBT singlet excitons promptly convert to the interfacial charge transfer (CT) state that is a Coulombically bound charge pair of PCPDTBT polaron and PCBM anion at the heterojunction with almost 100% efficiency in a picosecond. In other words, the exciton diffusion efficiency η ED and charge transfer efficiency η CT are 100% in this blend, which are higher than and comparable to those of the RR-P3HT/PCBM solar cell, respectively. On a time scale of nanoseconds, 70% of the PCPDTBT bound polarons are dissociated into free charge carriers, and the others recombine geminately to the ground state through the CT state. The charge dissociation efficiency η CD = 70% is lower than that of RR-P3HT/PCBM solar cells. The PCPDTBT dissociated polarons recombine bimolecularly on a time scale of nano- to microseconds with a charge lifetime of ∼10 -7 s, which is shorter than that observed for RR-P3HT/PCBM blends. In summary, the lower charge dissociation efficiency and shorter charge lifetime are the limiting factors for the photovoltaic performance of PCPDTBT/PCBM solar cells. Furthermore, the origin of such limitation is also discussed in terms of the charge dissociation and recombination through the interfacial CT state in PCPDTBT/PCBM blends. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) are currently a major focus of research in the development of bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs). In contrast to the widely used fullerene acceptors (FAs), the optical properties and electronic energy levels of NFAs can be readily tuned. NFA-based OSCs can also achieve greater thermal stability and photochemical stability, as well as longer device lifetimes, than their FA-based counterparts. Historically, the performance of NFA OSCs has lagged behind that of fullerene devices. However, recent developments have led to a rapid increase in power conversion efficiencies for NFA OSCs, with values now exceeding 13%, demonstrating the viability of using NFAs to replace FAs in next-generation high-performance OSCs. This Review discusses the important work that has led to this remarkable progress, focusing on the two most promising NFA classes to date: rylene diimide-based materials and materials based on fused aromatic cores with strong electron-accepting end groups. The key structure-property relationships, donor-acceptor matching criteria and aspects of device physics are discussed. Finally, we consider the remaining challenges and promising future directions for the NFA OSCs field.},

For films with micro m thickness, the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency is .apprx.60% at l = 750 nm under reverse voltage bias and the photocurrent to dark current ratio is .apprx.8.6 at 900 nm and remains 3.6 even at 1000 nm.

The proposed device has an average transmittance of 40.3% in the visible range of 400-700 nm and a high quality transparency spectrum for plant growth with a crop growth factor of 41.9%, considering the weight of the AM 1.5G solar spectrum. Compared with the corresponding transparent OPV without photonic crystals, an enhancement of 20.7% in the average transmittance and of 24.5% in the crop growth factor are achieved. Detailed investigations reveal that the improved transmittance is attributed to the excitation of the optical Tamm state and the light interference effect in TPC. Concomitantly, the total absorption efficiency in the active layer of the designed TPC based transparent OPV reaches 51.5%, being 1.78% higher than that of the transparent OPV without PC and 76% of that of the opaque counterpart. The improved absorption originates from the Bragg forbidden reflectance of TPC. Overall, our proposal achieves the optimized utilization of sunlight by light manipulation of TPC.},

   abstract = {The power conversion efficiency of hybrid halide perovskite solar cells is profoundly influenced by the operating temperature. Here we investigate the temperature influence on the electronic band structure and optical absorption of cubic CH3NH3PbI3 from first-principles by accounting for both the electron-phonon interaction and thermal expansion. Within the framework of density functional perturbation theory, the electron-phonon coupling induces slightly enlarged band gap and strongly broadened electronic relaxation time as temperature increases. The large broadening effect is mainly due to the presence of cation organic atoms. Consequently, the temperature-dependent absorption peak exhibits blue-shift position, decreased amplitude, and broadened width. This work uncovers the atomistic origin of temperature influence on the optical absorption of cubic CH3NH3PbI3 and can provide guidance to design high-performance hybrid halide perovskite solar cells at different operating temperatures.},

Currently, regular improvements in organic photodetectors are made with respect to their important figure-of-merit performances, which have caught up to or even surpassed the performances of inorganic Si and Ge-based photodetectors. Importantly, the spectral response of organic photodetectors covers a wide range of wavelengths, from the ultraviolet to near-infrared regions, with low-band-gap organic semiconductors as the active medium. In this paper, the working mechanism and recent advances in organic semiconductor photodetectors are comprehensively reviewed and the challenges in the field, mainly focusing on the performance of organic photodetectors, studies oriented toward applications, and the expectations of organic semiconductor photodetectors in the future, are disclosed.},

The photodetector shows good rectification ratio in the dark, while under illumination, the photovoltaic effect is observed within an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE). The increase and decrease of photocurrent response around 100 ns are attributed to the slow and dispersive transport of holes in the polymer. The results of noise spectra of the NIR-PD shows that the noise current approaches the shot noise limit within 3 dB. The surface of the polymer film is found to be very rough with root-mean square roughness of 15 nm, which is due to the limited solubility of polymer in dichlorobenzene during the spin coating process.},

   abstract = {Organic solar cells are thought to suffer from poor thermal stability of the active layer nanostructure, a common belief that is based on the extensive work that has been carried out on fullerene-based systems. We show that a widely studied non-fullerene acceptor, the indacenodithienothiophene-based acceptor ITIC, crystallizes in a profoundly different way as compared to fullerenes. Although fullerenes are frozen below the glass-transition temperature Tg of the photovoltaic blend, ITIC can undergo a glass-crystal transition considerably below its high Tg of ∼180 °C. Nanoscopic crystallites of a low-temperature polymorph are able to form through a diffusion-limited crystallization process. The resulting fine-grained nanostructure does not evolve further with time and hence is characterized by a high degree of thermal stability. Instead, above Tg, the low temperature polymorph melts, and micrometer-sized crystals of a high-temperature polymorph develop, enabled by more rapid diffusion and hence long-range mass transport. This leads to the same detrimental decrease in photovoltaic performance that is known to occur also in the case of fullerene-based blends. Besides explaining the superior thermal stability of non-fullerene blends at relatively high temperatures, our work introduces a new rationale for the design of bulk heterojunctions that is not based on the selection of high-Tg materials per se but diffusion-limited crystallization. The planar structure of ITIC and potentially other non-fullerene acceptors readily facilitates the desired glass-crystal transition, which constitutes a significant advantage over fullerenes, and may pave the way for truly stable organic solar cells.},

   abstract = {Tandem photovoltaic modules with silicon bottom cells offer a promising route to exceed the single-junction photovoltaic efficiency limit and further lower the levelized cost of solar electricity. However, it is unclear whether continued improvements in efficiency will render tandem modules cost-competitive with their two constituent sub-cells, and with silicon technology in particular. Here, we construct a simple and versatile techno-economic model that, for a given balance-of-systems scenario, calculates the tandem module efficiency and cost from assumed sub-cell module efficiencies and costs. To understand which input conditions are likely to be representative of the future photovoltaic market, we calculate learning rates for both module and area-related balance-of-system costs, and find that the slower learning rate of the latter means that high-efficiency tandems will become increasingly attractive. Further, in the residential market in 2020, the model indicates that top-cell modules could cost up to US$100 m–2—over twice that of the projected silicon module cost—and the associated tandem module would be cost-competitive if its energy yield, degradation rate, service life and financing terms are similar to those of silicon.},

   abstract = {As the solar electricity market has matured, energy conversion efficiency and storage have joined installed system cost as significant market drivers. In response, manufacturers of flat-plate silicon photovoltaic (PV) cells have pushed cell efficiencies above 25% - nearing the 29.4% detailed-balance efficiency limit - and both solar thermal and battery storage technologies have been deployed at utility scale. This paper introduces a new tandem solar collector employing a 'PVMirror' that has the potential to both increase energy conversion efficiency and provide thermal storage. A PVMirror is a concentrating mirror, spectrum splitter, and light-to-electricity converter all in one: It consists of a curved arrangement of PV cells that absorb part of the solar spectrum and reflect the remainder to their shared focus, at which a second solar converter is placed. A strength of the design is that the solar converter at the focus can be of a radically different technology than the PV cells in the PVMirror; another is that the PVMirror converts a portion of the diffuse light to electricity in addition to the direct light. We consider two case studies - a PV cell located at the focus of the PVMirror to form a four-terminal PV-PV tandem, and a thermal receiver located at the focus to form a PV-CSP (concentrating solar thermal power) tandem - and compare the outdoor energy outputs to those of competing technologies. PVMirrors can outperform (idealized) monolithic PV-PV tandems that are under concentration, and they can also generate nearly as much energy as silicon flat-plate PV while simultaneously providing the full energy storage benefit of CSP.},

   abstract = {The ferroelectric-photovoltaic (FE-PV) device, in which a homogeneous ferroelectric material is used as a light absorbing layer, has been investigated during the past several decades with numerous ferroelectric oxides. The FE-PV effect is distinctly different from the typical photovoltaic (PV) effect in semiconductor p-n junctions in that the polarization electric field is the driving force for the photocurrent in FE-PV devices. In addition, the anomalous photovoltaic effect, in which the voltage output along the polarization direction can be significantly larger than the bandgap of the ferroelectric materials, has been frequently observed in FE-PV devices. However, a big challenge faced by the FE-PV devices is the very low photocurrent output. The research interest in FE-PV devices has been re-spurred by the recent discovery of above-bandgap photovoltage in materials with ferroelectric domain walls, electric switchable diodes and photovoltaic effects, tip-enhanced photovoltaic effects at the nanoscale, and new low-bandgap ferroelectric materials and device design. In this feature article, we reviewed the advance in understanding the mechanisms of the ferroelectric photovoltaic effects and recent progress in improving the photovoltaic device performance, including the emerging approaches of integrating the ferroelectric materials into organic heterojunction photovoltaic devices for very high efficiency PV devices.

Thermal annealing of the full devices was found to substantially recover thick-film device efficiencies while reducing the thin-film device efficiencies. The profound variations in photovoltaic characteristics were interpreted in terms of vertical phase separation in the P3HT:PCBM blend film and Li+ diffusion from the LiF/Al contact. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

Neutron reflectivity, with the application of magnetic contrast variation, was used to investigate the concentration profile of PC71BM within the active layer. And this profile was found to be homogeneous through the film thickness. Small angle neutron scattering was utilized to find there is amorphous PC71BM even at 50 wt% of fullerene while previously it was believed that all fullerene was consumed to form co-crystals when its concentration is below 75 wt%. These fullerene molecules evolve into approximately 15 nm sized agglomerates to improve the electron transport when their concentration is above 75 wt%. Thermal annealing gives these agglomerates mobility to form micrometer sized crystals causing a decrease of device performance. These findings can therefore correlate the morphology, especially in terms of fullerene agglomerates, vertical concentration profile and percolating structure they formed, with the device performance and provide valuable guidance for optimal morphology design of polymer: fullerene solar cells.},

In this work, the interfacial stability is studied by using highly stable all-polymer solar cell as a platform. It is found that the thermally deposited metal electrode atoms can diffuse into the active layer during device storage, which consequently greatly decreases the power conversion efficiency. Fortunately, the diffusion of metal atoms can be slowed down and even blocked by using thicker interlayer materials, high-glass-transition-temperature interlayer materials, or a tandem device structure. Learning from this, homojunction tandem all-PSCs are successfully developed that simultaneously exhibit a record power conversion efficiency over 11% and remarkable stability with efficiency retaining 93% of the initial value after thermally aging at 80 °C for 1000 h.},

   abstract = {Heterojunction silicon with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) solar cells that combine advanced thin-film hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si) technologies are promising because of the high performance at low cost. Due to the low conductivity of a-Si:H, indium tin oxide (ITO) needs to be used as a front contact layer on top of a-Si:H in order to collect photogenerated currents. The thin a-Si:H layer requires the ITO deposition to be soft so that the passivation is maintained after deposition. Otherwise, the passivation degradation resulting from ITO deposition should be recovered by some post processing. In this contribution, we investigate how the power density and the temperature during ITO deposition as well as post annealing influence the passivation quality of HIT solar cells as characterised by the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and minority carrier lifetime. Firstly, ITO sputtering with lower power density can reduce the degradation of the passivation quality after ITO deposition. Secondly, we have investigated the simultaneous annealing during ITO deposition at elevated temperature. On one hand, simultaneous annealing can recover some of the degradation resulting from sputtering. On the other hand, there is a temperature threshold above which degradation of the passivation is observed, probably by hydrogen effusion. Thirdly, we observe that post annealing can fully recover the degradation resulting from ITO sputtering at room temperature (RT). © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Tuning the blend composition is an essential step to optimize the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. PCEs from devices of unoptimized donor:acceptor (D:A) weight ratio are generally significantly lower than optimized devices. Here, two high-performance organic nonfullerene BHJ blends PBDB-T:ITIC and PBDB-T:N2200 are adopted to investigate the effect of blend ratio on device performance. It is found that the PCEs of polymer-polymer (PBDB-T:N2200) blend are more tolerant to composition changes, relative to polymer-molecule (PBDB-T:ITIC) devices. In both systems, short-circuit current density (Jsc) is tracked closely with PCE, indicating that exciton dissociation and transport strongly influence PCEs. With dilute acceptor concentrations, polymer-polymer blends maintain high electron mobility relative to the polymer-molecule blends, which explains the dramatic difference in PCEs between them as a function of D:A blend ratio. In addition, polymer-polymer solar cells, especially at high D:A blend ratio, are stable (less than 5% relative loss) over 70 d under continuous heating at 80 °C in a glovebox without encapsulation. This work demonstrates that all-polymer solar cells show advantage in operational lifetime under thermal stress and blend-ratio resilience, which indicates their high potential for designing of stable and scalable solar cells.},

The assessment of OPV stability and lifetime are usually based on simulated degradation experiments conducted under indoor conditions, whereas photovoltaic devices experience different environmental conditions under outdoor operation. Besides the intrinsic degradation of OPV devices due to the evolution of optoelectronic and morphological structure during long-term operation, outdoor environmental changes can impose extra stresses and accelerate the degradation of OPV modules. Although outdoor studies on long-term OPV stability are restricted by the long data collection times, they provide direct information on OPV stability under mixed degradation stresses and are therefore invaluable from the point of view of both research and practical application. Here, an overview of the current status of outdoor lifetime studies of OPVs is provided. After a summary of device lifetime extrapolated from indoor studies, outdoor lifetime testing platforms are introduced and the operational lifetime of various OPV devices are reviewed. The influence of climate and weather parameters on device performance and burn-in phenomena observed during the degradation of OPVs is then discussed.

   abstract = {Halogenation is a very efficient chemical modification method to tune the molecular energy levels, absorption spectra and molecular packing of organic semiconductors. Recently, in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs), both fluorine- and chlorinesubstituted photovoltaic materials, including donors and acceptors, demonstrated their great potentials in achieving high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), raising a question that how to make a decision between fluorination and chlorination when designing materials. Herein, we systemically studied the impact of fluorination and chlorination on the properties of resulting donors (PBDB-T-2F and PBDB-T-2Cl) and acceptors (IT-4F and IT-4Cl). The results suggest that all the OSCs based on different donor and acceptor combinations can deliver good PCEs around 13%–14%. Chlorination is more effective than fluorination in downshifting the molecular energy levels and broadening the absorption spectra. The influence of chlorination and fluorination on the crystallinity of the resulting materials is dependent on their introduction positions. As chlorination has the advantage of easy synthesis, it is more attractive in designing low-cost photovoltaic materials and therefore may have more potential in largescale applications.},

   abstract = {Nonfullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) are fabricated with a perylene monoimide-based n-type wide-bandgap organic semiconductor PMI-F-PMI as an acceptor and a bithienyl-benzodithiophene-based wide-bandgap copolymer PTZ1 as a donor. The PSCs based on PTZ1:PMI-F-PMI (2:1, w/w) with the treatment of a mixed solvent additive of 0.5% N-methyl pyrrolidone and 0.5% diphenyl ether demonstrate a very high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.3 V with a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6%. The high Voc of the PSCs is a result of the high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of −3.42 eV of the PMI-F-PMI acceptor and the low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of −5.31 eV of the polymer donor. Very interestingly, the exciton dissociation efficiency in the active layer is quite high, even though the LUMO and HOMO energy differences between the donor and acceptor materials are as small as ≈0.08 and 0.19 eV, respectively. The PCE of 6% is the highest for the PSCs with a Voc as high as 1.3 V. The results indicate that the active layer based on PTZ1/PMI-F-PMI can be used as the front layer in tandem PSCs for achieving high Voc over 2 V.},

   abstract = {We report a novel small molecule acceptor (SMA) named FTTB-PDI4 obtained via ring-fusion between the thiophene and perylene diimide (PDI) units of a PDI-tetramer with a tetrathienylbezene (TTB) core. A small voltage loss of 0.53 V and a high power conversion efficiency of 10.58% were achieved, which is the highest value reported for PDI-based devices to date. By comparing the fused and nonfused SMAs, we show that the ring-fusion introduces several beneficial effects on the properties and performances of the acceptor material, including more favorable energy levels, enhanced light absorption and stronger intermolecular packing. Interestingly, morphology data reveal that the fused molecule yields higher domain purity and thus can better maintain its molecular packing and electron mobility in the blend. Theoretical calculations also demonstrate that FTTB-PDI4 exhibits a "double-decker" geometry with two pairs of mostly parallel PDI units, which is distinctively different from reported PDI-tetramers with highly twisted geometries and can explain the better performance of the material. This work highlights the promising design of PDI-based acceptors by the ring-fusion strategy.},

   abstract = {Hypoxic tolerance experiments may be helpful to constrain the oxygen requirement for animal evolution. Based on literature review, available data demonstrate that fishes are more sensitive to hypoxia than crustaceans and echinoderms, which in turn are more sensitive than annelids, whilst mollusks are the least sensitive. Mortalities occur where O2 concentrations are below 2.0 mg/L, equivalent to saturation with oxygen content about 25% PAL (present atmospheric level). Therefore, the minimal oxygen requirement for maintaining animal diversity since Cambrian is determined as 25% PAL. The traditional view is that a rise in atmospheric oxygen concentrations led to the oxygenation of the ocean, thus triggering the evolution of animals. Geological and geochemical studies suggest a constant increase of the oxygen level and a contraction of anoxic oceans during Ediacaran–Cambrian transition when the world oceans experienced a rapid diversification of metazoan lineages. However, fossil first appearances of animal phyla are obviously asynchronous and episodic, showing a sequence as: basal metazoans>lophotrochozoans>ecdysozoans and deuterostomes. According to hitherto known data of fossil record and hypoxic sensitivity of animals, the appearance sequence of different animals is broadly consistent with their hypoxic sensitivity: animals like molluscs and annelids that are less sensitive to hypoxia appeared earlier, while animals like echinoderms and fishes that are more sensitive to hypoxia came later. Therefore, it is very likely that the appearance order of animals is corresponding to the increasing oxygen level and/or the contraction of anoxic oceans during Ediacaran–Cambrian transition.},

   abstract = {In this work, photovoltaic properties of the PBDB-T:ITIC based-NF-PSCs were fully optimized and characterized by tuning the morphology of the active layers and changing the device architecture. First, donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratios were scanned, and then further optimization was performed by using different additives, i.e. 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), diphenyl ether (DPE), 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), on the basis of best D/A ratio (1:1, w/w), respectively. Finally, the conventional or inverted device architectures with different buffer layers were employed to fabricate NF-PSC devices, and meanwhile, the morphology of the active layers was further optimized by controlling annealing temperature and time. As a result, a record efficiency of 11.3% was achieved, which is the highest result for NF-PSCs. It’s also remarkable that the inverted NF-PSCs exhibited long-term stability, i.e. the best-performing devices maintain 83% of their initial PCEs after over 4000 h storage.},

   abstract = {? 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Ultraviolet (UV) organic photodetectors (OPDs) operated in the photovoltaic mode, achieving a very high on/off ratio of 105 and a fast response time of 20 ns (a decay time of 888 ns), are demonstrated in this work. Light-induced tuning of the barrier height at the two interfaces of the carrier-extraction layer and light-induced tuning of series resistance are proposed to obtain the high on/off ratio. Fast response of the device is demonstrated through the ultrafast trap filling process. The high on/off ratio and fast response are simultaneously realized by introducing TiO2 nanocrystals as the electron-extraction layer of OPDs. In addition, the good on/off ratio can be maintained in a wide concentration range of 2,2?-(1,3-phenylene)bis[5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole] (OXD-7) from 25% to 3.75% in the N,N?-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N?-bis(phenyl)benzidine (NPB):OXD-7 active layer and the corresponding OPDs can also achieve a fast response time simultaneously, good for its practical application. With the optimized device structure, a large detectivity of over 1012 Jones covering the UV-A region (320-400 nm) and a high linear dynamic range of 100 dB are obtained. Additionally, stability of TiO2-based OPDs, which is not well studied but an important parameter for OPDs, is experimentally investigated. A new approach to light-induced tuning of extraction and injection barrier heights as well as the series resistance is realized by introducing TiO2 nanocrystals as the electron-extraction layer of organic photodetectors. TiO2-based UV photodetectors at the photovoltaic mode achieve a ultrahigh on/off ratio of 105, which is the best value for UV organic photodetectors. Copyright},

However, major problem to be solved before industrial production could become economically viable is represented by their still low conversion efficiency. The organic solar cell architectures are presently the result of a compromise between achieving complete light absorption using active layers that are thicker than the optical absorption length and achieving efficient charge collection at the electrodes which is favoured in thinner layers. We present a concept and its experimental demonstration that would solve efficiently the above trade-off problem by making use of a new type of light trapping elements.

   abstract = {In times of dwindling fossil fuels it is particularly crucial to develop novel "green" technologies in order to cover the increasing worldwide demand for energy. Organic photovoltaic solar cells (OPVs) are promising as a renewable energy source due to low energy requirement for production, low resource extraction, and no emission of greenhouse gasses during use. In contrast to silicium-based solar cells, OPVs offer the advantages of light-weight, semi-transparency and mechanical flexibility. As to a possible forthcoming large-scale production, the environmental impact of such OPVs should be assessed and compared to currently best available technologies. For the first time, this review compiles the existing knowledge and identifies gaps regarding the environmental impact of such OPVs in a systematic manner. In this regard, we discuss the components of a typical OPV layer by layer. We discuss the probability of enhanced release of OPV-borne components into the environment during use-phase (e.g. UV- and biodegradation) and end-of-life phase (e.g. incineration and waste disposal). For this purpose, we compiled available data on bioavailability, bioaccumulation, biodegradation, and ecotoxicity. Whereas considerable research has already been carried out concerning the ecotoxicity of certain OPV components (e.g. nanoparticles and fullerenes), others have not been investigated at all so far. In conclusion, there is a general lack of information about fate, behavior as well as potential ecotoxicity of most of the main OPV components and their degradation/transformation products. So far, there is no evidence for a worrying threat coming from OPVs, but since at present, no policy and procedures regarding recycling of OPVs are in action, in particular improper disposal upon end-of-life might result in an adverse effect of OPVs in the environment when applied in large-scale. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

We show that VP-SVA is useful not only for the well-studied P3HT:PC61BM model system, but also for modern OPV active layers based on nonfullerene acceptors. Phase separation and material crystallinity are precisely tuned by controlling the solvent vapor concentration used during the annealing process, as evidenced by photoinduced force microscopy (PiFM) and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The results show that overannealing occurs at saturated solvent vapor pressures, highlighting the importance of the VP-SVA technique.},

The US Department of Energy cost goal for thin films is about $0.33/Wp, which is based on a module efficiency goal of about 15% and module manufacturing costs of about $50/m2. This paper investigates the issues associated with achieving the $50/m2 goal based on opportunities for manufacturing cost reductions. Key areas such as capital costs, deposition rates, layer thickness, materials costs, yields, substrates, and front and back end costs will be examined. Several prior studies support the potential of thin films to reach $50/m2. This paper will examine the necessary process research improvements needed in amorphous silicon, copper indium diselenide, cadmium telluride, and experimental thin film silicon PV technologies to reach this ambitious goal. One major conclusion is that materials costs must be reduced because they will dominate in mature technologies. Another is that module efficiency could be the overriding parameter if different thin films each optimize their manufacturing to a similar level.},
